This book teaches that the work of G-d is so difficult, that no one person can do it alone. People working together is a picture of what is involved in being in a Messianic kehillah or any ministry for G-d. We are inspired as we see how the wall came together in only 52 days (see Neh 6:15) when Nehemiah arrived in 445. However, everything was not accomplished quite so fast. The Mizbe\u2019ach and the Beis Hamikdash were restored and the work took place from 538-515 B.C.E. and was finally completed after Darius I (522-486 B.C.E.) gave his official permission, though the foundation of the Beis Hamikdash was laid as early as 536 B.C.E. Then came the reforming work of Ezra in 458 B.C.E. during the reign of Artaxerxes I (465-424)."
