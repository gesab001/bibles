                    "verse": "Thus saith Koresh Melech Paras (Persia), Kol Mamlechot HaAretz (all the kingdoms of the earth) hath Hashem Elohei HaShomayim given me; and He hath charged me to build Him a Beis in Yerushalayim, which is in Yehudah. Who is there among you of all His people? Hashem Elohav be with him and let him go up! [T.N. The glory cloud that appears at the dedication of both the wilderness Mishkan and the Beis HaMikdash of Shlomo HaMelech is a prophetic type and foreshadow of the Moshiach and the coming sod hitgashmut (see 2Chr 5:7-14; Ex 40:34-35; Yn 1:1, 14)"
