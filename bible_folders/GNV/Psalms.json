For the effect hereof is, 1 That they be blessed which give themselves wholly all their life to the holy Scriptures;\u20034 and that the wicked contemners of God, though they seem for a while happy, yet at length shall come to miserable destruction. Blessed is the man that doth not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful."
