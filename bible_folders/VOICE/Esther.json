In Esther\u2019s case, she risks her own life in order to save her people, and in a greater sense to ensure that the story of redemption continues. The world has always endured times of great injustice, times of great need. Yet God is at work, transforming sorrow to joy, shame to honor, and injustice to justice. Each person is called to impact the age in which he or she lives. Across his empire, on the land and along the coasts, King Ahasuerus imposed taxation upon the people."
