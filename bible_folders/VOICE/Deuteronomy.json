Much of the action takes place in flashbacks as Moses recalls events and describes them to the Israelites in a drama. As we\u2019ve been seeing in this opening historical section of the book, sometimes there are even layers of voices. At one point, Moses speaks in the voice of the people as they speak in the voice of the spies. Shortly we\u2019ll see Moses speaking in the voice of the Lord as He speaks in Moses\u2019 own voice! It begins by showing a storyteller and then shifts locations repeatedly in space and time to depict the various episodes he\u2019s describing, with his voice providing continuity throughout. Deuteronomy has a timeless, ancient-modern feel because the story of God\u2019s work on earth really is written and told by people as they struggle, with varying degrees of success, to understand God\u2019s purposes and to join with those people of God who have gone before us. But you approached me with ideas of your own: \u201cCouldn\u2019t we send a few people in to investigate first? They could explore the land, come back, and tell us what route we should take and what cities we\u2019d come to along the way.\u201d"

Particularly when this is done under the leadership of people appointed by God, or even on God\u2019s direct instructions, many serious questions are raised. How is this consistent with God\u2019s mercy? Interpreters have taken different approaches to try to account for episodes like these, but many problems still remain. Perhaps the best that can be done is to acknowledge that the Bible presents us with a mixture of materials. Mostly God\u2019s mercy, kindness, and forgiveness are stressed; but sometimes we do see judgments of God, whether through natural forces such as flood and fire, or through human armies, carried out against entire populations. Which of these attributes, mercy or justice, most essentially characterizes God? Which passages should we consider normative for our own guidance today, and which ones should we see as exceptional and interpret in light of the others? Discerning why and how these exceptional circumstances arose remains a matter for thoughtful students of the Bible to reflect on with reverence and concern. We were in the wilderness of Kedemoth when I sent messengers to King Sihon in Heshbon and offered him these terms of peace:"

Perhaps no warning is more urgently needed for God\u2019s people in our own wealthy and comfortable society. Prosperity can tempt us to forget about God and to act as if we can take care of everything through our own means. But with prosperity often comes poverty. These humbling, testing experiences are meant to build the qualities of gratitude and trust into our lives, and they keep us from forgetting God even when we do enjoy prosperity.

That covenant has been conditional on the people maintaining an exclusive allegiance to the Lord, and they have violated this essential requirement. Now, however, through the intercession of Moses, the people are accepted into a second, new covenant on the basis of His forgiveness and mercy. Its continuation is also conditional on their obedience, but its deepest foundation is a grace anticipating the new covenant God ultimately makes with us through Jesus. The children of Israel had been staying by the wells that belong to the descendants of Jaakan. They moved from there to Moserah. There, Aaron died and was buried. His son, Eleazar, succeeded him as high priest."

It\u2019s not an absolute rule that those who obey God will directly receive blessings in this life, and that those who disobey will suffer immediate consequences as a result. However, this is still generally true. His people should obey simply because the Lord is entitled to their unswerving loyalty and devotion (not because of any promised rewards). God delights to reward obedience, and His people should embrace His generosity gratefully whenever they receive it. Moses: When the Eternal your God brings you into the land where you\u2019re going to live when you cross the Jordan, half of you are going to stand on Mount Gerizim and shout out the blessings that will come to those who obey the Lord. The other half of you will stand on Mount Ebal on the other side of the valley and shout out the curses that will fall on those who disobey Him."

The Eternal One\u2019s presence is supremely holy, thus the concern for decency in the camp where the Eternal One travels with the army.
