When Jeroboam won back the region, the people celebrated (2 Kings 14:23\u201329); but Jeroboam was out of step with God, so the joy was short-lived. That\u2019s where the names of the two cities become interesting. In Hebrew Lo-debar means \u201cno thing\u201d; Karnaim means \u201chorns,\u201d and horns are a symbol of strength.

God will have none of it.
