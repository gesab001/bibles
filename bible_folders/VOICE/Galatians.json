Paul counters the attack by distancing himself from any human institution: he was not called by any church or committee. God the Father and the Lord Jesus commissioned Paul directly to be the emissary to the nations. Frankly I am stunned.

Seldom does Paul relate that story in his letters. He doesn\u2019t need to because he usually does that in person when he is planting a church. But on this occasion, as he defends his call and the gospel, he retells a bit of his personal history to underscore the complete metamorphosis that has taken place in his life. In his former life, Paul admits\u2014quite painfully, no doubt\u2014that he tried to destroy this movement. Borrowing language from the prophets, Paul narrates how God unveiled to him the truth about Jesus. At just the right moment, even while Paul was an active enemy, God revealed His Son to Paul and called him to be heaven\u2019s emissary to the nations. Paul immediately stopped his campaign against the church, which was just beginning to emerge from its Jewish roots and spread to the Gentile nations. Listen carefully. None of the Jerusalem leaders insisted that Titus be circumcised, although he is Greek."

They advocate that Gentile outsiders need to follow Jewish ways and practices to become full members of the family of God. Paul\u2014and the Jerusalem council (Acts 15)\u2014strongly reject this. The apostle argues that it is only the faithfulness of Jesus and the presence of the Spirit that serve as the foundation of the new covenant and as the entrance into the people of God.
