The expatriates are counting the days until they can return to their ancestral lands in order to rebuild the temple. If Ezekiel is 30 years old when he has his initial vision, he is about 50 years old when he has the temple vision (chapters 40\u201348). The word of the Eternal One came to Ezekiel the priest (Buzi\u2019s son) near the Chebar Canal in the land of the Chaldeans. It was there that the hand of the Eternal settled on him."

Though God is unseen, from time to time human beings are given the privilege of seeing His glory. This glory accompanies Israel in the wilderness and resides in the temple in Jerusalem.

The Babylonians first assaulted Jerusalem in 605 B.C. and took some of the chief citizens into exile.

The current exiles can hardly imagine anything worse, but it will happen. In 586 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar will return to Jerusalem, and this time he will leave nothing but ashes. After a grueling 18-month siege, Nebuchadnezzar will break through Jerusalem\u2019s wall and level it, take whatever riches he desires, burn every building (including God\u2019s temple) to the ground, and deport what few people survive the battle. This final battle and conquest will decimate God\u2019s home; it will leave Jerusalem in ruins. There will be no place left for the exiles to return.

But the Daniel most people know as the biblical prophet will achieve his fame long after Ezekiel dies. The Daniel mentioned here is not the biblical prophet but another Daniel (also known as Danel) whose story is found in an ancient Ugaritic text called the Epic of Aqhat. Like Noah and Job, Danel is an ancient non-Israelite who lives to an old age and becomes famous for his wisdom. Like Noah, he is surrounded by wicked people; like Job, he loses a son. Perhaps God references these non-Israelite heroes\u2014as opposed to the people\u2019s Israelite ancestors\u2014because Ezekiel\u2019s audience is living outside of Israel. They would be able to identify with the foreign cultures in these accounts because they are surrounded by the strange customs and the novel stories of Babylon. These three men show an unusual level of devotion to God when the culture around them appears to be moving contrary to His way, so they are more appropriate examples than any Israelite ancestor\u2014such as David, Solomon, or Josiah\u2014who had all the benefits and blessings of God\u2019s covenants.

Even as God lovingly supplies His flock with plenty of good food, clear water, and pleasant pastures, some trample what they can\u2019t control and foul what they can\u2019t consume. Some bully and push their weight around, while others move aside or run for the hills. Again God sees the problem and promises to step in, personally, to rescue His hassled people and put an end to injustice. So God promises to send another shepherd-ruler, in the spirit of King David, who will love and care for the flock as God Himself does. This Davidic shepherd will be unlike the wicked, neglectful shepherd-rulers in Israel\u2019s past; this son of David will rule as their prince in submission to Israel\u2019s one True God. But there is more. In the final movement of this oracle, God announces a new covenant\u2014a covenant of peace. Its scope is beyond human community and politics. It is a renewal of life in the land of Israel and, by extension, in the rest of creation. The Eternal said this,"

What God\u2019s people need more than anything is for God to do a work of grace within them. Like other prophets of his day, Ezekiel is convinced that heaven must intervene in order to fix what is wrong on earth. It is not enough for people to try harder and do better. This work of grace begins with God cleansing His people with fresh water. Idolatry and various sins have made them impure and unclean, so before they can be restored, they must be made pure by the washing of water. Then, once God gives them a new heart, His people will become willing covenant partners; they will give up on their rebellious, hurtful ways and embrace God\u2019s designs for their lives. With a new spirit\u2014which seems to be nothing other than God\u2019s Spirit living in and among them\u2014they will have the desire and ability to live out God\u2019s reasonable demands on them. God insists that all He intends to do to save and redeem His people is not for their good; He is working to restore His good name. God\u2019s covenant people have given Him a bad reputation among the nations, so God must act in His own interest to make sure His name is given the honor it is due. Eternal One (to Ezekiel): Son of man, do you think these bones can live? Ezekiel: Eternal Lord, certainly You know the answer better than I do."

The outer walls form a square with priestly kitchens for preparing sacrifices and food on each corner. On the four sides of the temple complex, a total of thirty chambers line the perimeter wall. The actual temple and inner courtyard is a smaller version of the outer walls, three gates (east, north, and south), and outer courtyard. As Ezekiel walks in a westerly direction from the outer east gate, he ascends a set of stairs that leads to the outer courtyard where he then goes up another staircase to the inner courtyard and altar where he then finds a third staircase leading to the temple portico and the two holy and most holy chambers of the Eternal\u2019s sanctuary. Ezekiel\u2019s mysterious tour guide first begins at the eastern outer gate facing the rising sun. Then he takes Ezekiel to the outer courtyard where he measures the north gate before taking him to the south gate for its measurements. They then enter the inner courtyard via its south gate. Now at the inner courtyard, they follow the same path of measuring the east and north gates. Finally, after exiting the north gate of the inner courtyard, they move to the original east gate of the outer courtyard where Ezekiel witnesses the awesome return of the Eternal\u2019s presence. During the 25th year of our exile (which was the 14th year after Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem), at the beginning of the year on the 10th day of the month, the Eternal took hold of me and brought me to the ruined city."

Since Jerusalem\u2019s temple was completely destroyed, archaeology is helpful in reconstructing Ezekiel\u2019s description of it. In Northern Syria lie the ruins of a temple at \u2018Ain Dara\u2018 that closely resemble the biblical descriptions of God\u2019s temple. It, too, had three rooms, winged beings guarding the holiest place, and an eastern gate through which a deity entered. But what might be the most helpful parallel between it and Jerusalem\u2019s temple are its windows. Carved into the stone are false windows, each with three successively smaller window frames\u2014the largest frame on the outside and the smallest on the inside. Apparently this architectural detail was popular in ornate Near Eastern buildings during the first millennium B.C., especially in temples, and it sheds light on Ezekiel\u2019s obscure description. Then the man whose appearance was like bronze took me north into the outer courtyard. He brought me to the chambers that were opposite the open area around the temple and opposite the outside wall on the northern end."

Leviticus 19 explains that Israelites were to love their foreign neighbors, treating them with special care because they were disadvantaged\u2014as widows and orphans were\u2014because they were not allowed to own land in Israel and therefore often couldn\u2019t provide for themselves. But God\u2019s new law changes this. For the first time, resident aliens who adopt the worship of Israel\u2019s God may legally join with the tribes and enjoy all of God\u2019s blessings in Israel. This only makes sense for the exiles who return to the land from all over the world and have difficulty proving their Israelite heritage. As generous as this law may seem, it is not the first instance of God\u2019s grace to those outside Israel; His kindness is demonstrated over and over again in the pages of Scripture. The very monarchy of Israel is descended from a resident alien, Ruth, the grandmother of King David. Certainly God loves equally all who know and worship Him. Here are the boundaries of the land: The northern boundary will run east from the Mediterranean Sea through Hethlon and along to Lebo-hamath and then Zedad. From there it will go through Berothah and Sibraim (which lie on the border between Damascus and Hamath), all the way to Hazer-hatticon (near the border of Hauran)."
