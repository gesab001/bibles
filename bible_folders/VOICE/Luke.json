                    "verse": "In the time of Jesus, Jewish life is centered in the temple in Jerusalem. Priests are responsible for the temple\u2019s activities\u2014which include receiving religious pilgrims and their sacrifices (cattle, sheep, goats, and doves). Animal sacrifices may sound strange to a modern society, but in the ancient world, they are quite common. The slaughter of animals is a daily experience; it is part of any meal that includes meat. So this meal brings together the Jewish family from near and far, seeking to affirm their connections to the one true and living God. Their gift of animals is their contribution to the meal. (The priests, by the way, are authorized to use the meat for the sustenance of their families.) The presentation of the blood and meat of these sacrifices is accompanied by a number of prescribed rituals, performed by priests wearing prescribed ornamental clothing, according to a prescribed schedule. As the story continues, these solemn rituals are interrupted in an unprecedented way. For those who love God, several other people have already written accounts of what God has been bringing to completion among us, using the reports of the original eyewitnesses, those who were there from the start to witness the fulfillment of prophecy. Like those other servants who have recorded the messages, I present to you my carefully researched, orderly account of these new teachings."

Zacharias is a priest working in the temple, but priests don\u2019t normally hear from God. Those who hear from God are called prophets, not priests. One becomes a priest by being born in a priestly family line. Prophets, on the other hand, arise unpredictably and have no special credentials except the message they carry. So Zacharias has no reason to believe his duties will be interrupted in this way. Often in the biblical story, when people receive a message from God\u2014after getting over the initial shock\u2014they start asking questions. They push back; they doubt. Messenger: Zacharias, your prayers have been heard. Your wife is going to have a son, and you will name him John."

In particular, he gives details of the emperor, governor, and other client rulers. With a toxic mixture of cruelty and might, these authorities lord their power over the common people. Yet these high and mighty are\u2014as Mary\u2019s poem describes\u2014destined to be brought down in the presence of a new kind of king and a new kind of kingdom. Jesus will exercise His authority in a radically different way\u2014not through domination and violence, but through love, healing, compassion, and service. John\u2019s father Zacharias is a priest who serves in Jerusalem at the temple. Among their other duties, priests perform ritual cleansings necessary for Jewish worshipers who become ceremonially unclean\u2014perhaps through contact with outsiders (non-Jewish people), perhaps through contact with blood or a dead body, perhaps through a physical illness. But when John appears on the scene, he hasn\u2019t followed in his father\u2019s footsteps. He\u2019s not fulfilling the role of the priest, but rather of the prophet. He works far outside of Jerusalem, and he baptizes people in the Jordan River, not near the temple. It\u2019s as if John is performing a symbolic drama: If you want to be in tune with God, the temple and its normal routines can\u2019t help you anymore. Instead of being cleansed there, you should come out to this radical preacher and let him cleanse you in the river. And his message isn\u2019t a polite, tame message. It\u2019s fiery and intense! God isn\u2019t interested in just routine religion. He wants changed lives! In Jerusalem Annas and Caiaphas were high priests in the temple. And in those days, out in the wilderness, John (son of Zacharias) received a message from God."

Luke places Jesus in the mainstream of biblical history, connected to King David, Abraham, Noah, and Adam. By connecting Jesus with Adam, and ultimately with God, Luke shows how Jesus is connected to and relevant for all people, and he may also be suggesting that in Jesus God is launching a new humanity, with Jesus as the new Adam. Unlike the first Adam, though, Jesus will be completely faithful to God, as the next episode makes clear. Perhaps echoing Adam and Eve being tempted by the serpent in the garden (Genesis 3:1\u20137), Luke moves from the stories of Jesus\u2019 beginnings to His temptation. When Jesus returned from the Jordan River, He was full of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit led Him away from the cities and towns and out into the desert."

It may start with individual responses, but it doesn\u2019t stop there. Jesus describes His purpose as proclaiming this message.

The kingdom of God doesn\u2019t throw all guilty people in jail; it doesn\u2019t execute everyone who has made mistakes or tell them they\u2019re just getting what they deserve. Instead, it brings forgiveness, reconciliation, a new start, a second chance. In this way, it mobilizes believers to have a new future.

For this reason, they are closely allied with another group called the Herodians, allies of Caesar\u2019s puppet king Herod.

Each group tries to trap Jesus, but He turns the tables on them, using each encounter to shed more light on the message of the kingdom of God. In case after case, Jesus brings His hearers to the heart of the matter; and again and again, the bottom-line issue is money.

Now, at this dramatic moment, Jesus again withdraws to pray\u2014in a solitude made more intense by the fact that He has asked His disciples to pray, too, but they have fallen asleep. And in this moment of anguished emotion, Jesus mouths a prayer that resonates with His consistent message of the Kingdom. He has taught His disciples to pray, \u201cMay Your kingdom come,\u201d which is a request for God\u2019s will to be done on earth as it is in heaven. Now, drenched in sweat, Jesus Himself prays simply for God\u2019s will to be done, even if it means He must drink the cup of suffering that awaits Him in the hours ahead. We often speak of having faith in Jesus; but we seldom speak of the faith of Jesus, a faith He demonstrated consistently throughout His life and especially at its end. In a moment of agony, Jesus still trusted God, still yielded His will to God, and still approached God as \u201cFather,\u201d placing Himself in the position of a child, in trust\u2014profound, tested, sincere. Once again He left the city as He had been doing during recent days, returning to Mount Olivet along with His disciples."

He doesn\u2019t advocate the use of violence\u2014in fact, when one of His disciples uses the sword to try to protect Jesus from arrest, Jesus heals the \u201cenemy\u201d and rebukes His disciple.

Jesus appropriates and transforms the symbol of their power into a symbol of His greater power. He makes the cross not the icon of violent domination, but the reverse. By hanging on the cross and speaking of forgiveness, Jesus shows that there is a greater power at work in the world than the power of domination: it\u2019s the power of God\u2019s saving and reconciling love.

It may mean \u201cepitome of humanity\u201d or \u201cprime example of what a human can be.\u201d But it also evokes a specific passage of Scripture that is very important to Jewish people, Daniel 7:13-27. There the phrase \u201cSon of Man\u201d refers to a king who receives an eternal and universal kingdom, and it also represents \u201cthe saints of the Most High\u201d\u2014the people of God. In light of Jesus\u2019 central message about the kingdom of God, it is likely that the phrase suggests Jesus is the long-awaited Anointed One who launches a new era in human history and who creates a community of people who represent the eternal and universal kingdom of God. In this way, \u201cSon of\u201d suggests \u201cnew generation of,\u201d and \u201cMan\u201d suggests \u201chumanity.\u201d Jesus is Himself the new generation of humanity (a second Adam, a new beginning), and the community He creates shares this identity (a new creation, a new humanity in Jesus). The two messengers here use this pregnant phrase in a way that shocks everyone: The way this long-awaited Anointed One receives His kingdom is not through conventional military victory where enemies are defeated and killed. No, this King receives His kingdom by suffering, dying, and rising again Himself. Amazing news\u2014good news! Two Men: Why are you seeking the living One in the place of the dead?"

Luke writes in hope that future believers will be taken up into this beautiful story that will never, ever end. Then He begins with Moses and continues, prophet by prophet, explaining the meaning of the Hebrew Scriptures, showing how they were talking about the very things that had happened to Jesus."
