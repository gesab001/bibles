The teacher drives this point home by reminding his reader that human lives and earthly accomplishments are fleeting. Nothing tangible is permanent. No work lasts. It all slips away and vanishes into thin air. Compare that to God. Everything God does is substantial. Everything God accomplishes lasts forever. Every word God speaks makes a difference. And so, God places within every person a sense of eternity to know yet not understand Him. This world with all its goodness and beauty is not as good as it gets. There is more, so much more, and we are made for that reality too. But not now, not yet. The creation story in Genesis 2 recognizes the common origin of humanity and the animals. There God forms the first human from the \u201cdirt out of the ground\u201d and breathes into him the breath of life, and the man known as Adam becomes a living being. But within a few short verses, God declares that it is \u201cnot good\u201d for Adam to be alone and seeks a \u201cperfectly suited partner\u201d for the human. So God forms from the \u201cground\u201d every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and He brings them to Adam to see if any of them are a \u201cright and proper partner.\u201d Finally, when no suitable companion has been found, God fashions another creature from Adam\u2019s own human flesh. When Adam sees her, he knows he has met a perfect partner. Clearly, both Genesis and Ecclesiastes stress how much humanity shares in common with the animals. While we may be different\u2014as explained in the Genesis story\u2014we are all creatures, made of the same stuff, breathing the same air. And perhaps most to the point, we share a common destiny: death. Teacher: Again, I looked at everything that goes on under the sun and realized that in place of justice, wickedness prevails. In place of righteousness, wrongdoing succeeds."

In the creation account recorded in Genesis 2, God places the tree of the knowledge of \u201cgood and evil\u201d in the garden and commands the first couple not to eat of the tree. But that is precisely what they do; and in the act of eating, they gain knowledge of good and knowledge of what the absence of good brings. Adam and Eve\u2019s children live with this dichotomy. For example, when Cain is distressed over God\u2019s choice of Abel\u2019s offering over his, God says to Cain, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that as long as you do what is right, then I accept you? But if you do not do what is right, watch out, because sin is crouching at the door, ready to pounce on you!\u201d (Genesis 4:7). The temptation to scheme\u2014that is, to do the \u201cevil\u201d rather than the \u201cgood\u201d\u2014begins with the first human pair; the teacher of Ecclesiastes reminds his readers that the same temptation still exists.

In the Book of Psalms, \u201cremember\u201d occurs 45 times, sometimes written by the suffering faithful who cry out to God to remember (Psalms 25:6\u20137; 74:2, 18, 22; 89:47), and sometimes by the worshiper who marvels that God has remembered (Psalms 8:4; 78:39; 111:5; 136:23). Thus remembering in the Old Testament is an action of both God and God\u2019s people. Memory was as fundamental to the faith of ancient Israel as it is today. Believers gather together to remember who they are and to whom they belong. This communal memory shapes reality, forms identities, and determines right living. Not only did the teacher attain wisdom by careful observation, study, and setting out many proverbs, but he was also generous with his knowledge and eagerly shared it with people."
