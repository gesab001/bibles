Breaking that promise is like committing adultery, which is literally the destruction of a marriage covenant. Here, God is furious with Israel because they have chosen to serve the gods of other nations in addition to Him; they are committing adultery against Him. Under the rule of King Jeroboam II in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, worship of a Canaanite deity named Baal is common. Many people believe he is the god of weather and therefore the one who makes the earth fertile and produces crops. Like God, he is worshiped through the donation of gifts and sacrificing of animals, but Baal is also honored by the activities of prostitutes at shrines dedicated to him. The men and women who are employed at those shrines are paid for their fertility rituals by customers (worshipers) not only with money but also with the produce of the land their sexual activities supposedly fertilized: bread and water, wool and flax, oil and wine. Their mother was a prostitute; she brought shame on herself when she had these children. She chased her customers, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to go looking for my lovers. They\u2019re the ones who give me my bread and water, my wool and flax, my oil and wine.\u201d"

But leveling the city and slaughtering countless citizens isn\u2019t what ends Israel\u2019s legacy. In the years following the war, Sargon II systematically deports the remaining Israelites to cities in the Assyrian Empire and repopulates Samaria with foreigners to suppress future rebellions. This policy decimates the cultures of the ten tribes who inhabited the Northern Kingdom and leads to the fabled \u201cLost Tribes of Israel.\u201d It may be assumed that the members of the ten tribes assimilate into their new cultures and abandon their history and religion; they simply blend into their surroundings to survive. However, in the third century A.D., Christian poet Commodian compiles the writings of several early rabbis and weaves the story of the ten tribes\u2019 post-deportation lives. These ten tribes reside in a sort of paradise beyond a river, where everyone lives long lives, experiences no pain, and follows God\u2019s laws. One day, the story goes, these tribes will return to Jerusalem, recapture her, and dwell in her. I know Ephraim; Israel isn\u2019t hiding from Me. Even now Ephraim plays the part of a whore; Israel is covering herself in impurity."

Instead of relying on God, all of Israel\u2019s leaders allow themselves to be consumed in the regional politics.

Israel is the battleground between the empires, so Israel\u2019s kings think they can leverage the nation\u2019s geographical position and gain protection from one empire or the other by paying tributes. Instead, the cities are trampled in successive wars, and Israel\u2019s borders continue to shrink until Samaria is finally overrun by the Assyrians in 722 B.C. Even if they escape destruction, Egypt will be ready to gather them up, and Memphis will be set to bury them in the city\u2019s massive cemeteries.
