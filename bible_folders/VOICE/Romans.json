It starts with God\u2019s people, the Jews, but does not end until all people hear and respond to its call. The gospel reveals how right and faithful God has been all along. It begins with God\u2019s faithfulness to His creation and His covenant people. Then God acts, finally and decisively, in the cross of Jesus. For Paul the cross, more than any other event, displays Jesus\u2019 faithfulness to God the Father. As the Gospels tell us, in the garden of Gethsemane, Jesus entrusts Himself completely to God\u2019s will. As a result, this good news brings faith and hope to those who hear and respond to its elegant message. Because God is faithful, He acts in a most extraordinary way. Somehow in the scandal of the cross, He offers His own Son in order to redeem the fallen world. Paul, a servant of Jesus the Anointed called by God to be His emissary and appointed to tell the good news"

Sometimes their messages are a word-on-target to the people and powers of their day; at other times, they see and speak about the future. Their words not only predict the future\u2014they speak the word of the Lord, which creates reality and shapes the future. Paul describes the gospel of Jesus by bringing in the good news on two levels: On a human level, the good news is about God\u2019s Son, David\u2019s descendant, entering the world to begin the task of restoring it from the damage sin and death have left behind. But the resurrection of Jesus from the dead takes Jesus\u2019 sonship to a new level. Now He is the Son-of-God-in-Power, the One called Lord and Master. And here\u2019s what He\u2019s done: He has graced us and sanctioned us as His emissaries whose mission is to spread the one true and obedient faith to all people in the name of Jesus."

But when he arrives in Jerusalem, Paul\u2019s enemies trump up charges against him that ultimately land him in jail. So Paul makes it to Rome, but not as he planned. Several years later, after a lengthy confinement in Caesarea and a perilous journey at sea, he is led into Rome as a prisoner of the empire.
