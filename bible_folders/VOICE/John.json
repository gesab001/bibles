                    "verse": "This Gospel begins not with Jesus\u2019 birth or John\u2019s baptism but with a deliberate echo of the creation story in Genesis. It takes us back before time began to the moment when God interrupts the silence and speaks the cosmos into existence. Only John\u2019s Gospel names Jesus as the Logos and declares that He existed long before time was measured. This Greek word carries a variety of meanings, all relating to the act of speaking. It could be translated \u201cword,\u201d a thought that comes to expression, message, declaration, reason, or the content of preaching; most are found in various translations. It is clear that John means that logos is declared to all creation. John\u2019s use of logos is unique and has often been rendered as \u201cWord.\u201d While this is a useful translation, even a casual understanding demonstrates that \u201cWord\u201d reflects only part of its meaning. Most readers will interpret \u201cword\u201d as a unit of language\u2014a combination of sounds generally spoken but also written\u2014that carries meaning. To understand what John means, readers need something more than their cultural understanding of \u201cword\u201d; they need a new way of thinking about it. This is why we have chosen to offer another rendering, an interpretive, poetic translation, of what may be one of the most theologically loaded words in Scripture. Since logos essentially refers to the act of speaking or bringing thoughts to expression, we have decided to use the word \u201cvoice\u201d to capture that reality. John declares that truth has culminated in the person of Jesus. No single word captures the complete meaning of logos, but \u201cvoice\u201d has a number of advantages. First, \u201cvoice\u201d manifests the act of speaking. Voice is that which is spoken and that which is heard; it comes on both sides of any communication event, bridging the gap between sender and receiver. John intends that in Jesus God is speaking and revealing Himself to the world. Second, a voice is distinct and personal. We can distinguish people from one another simply by their voices. In John 10 Jesus describes the fact that the sheep hear the voice of the shepherd when he calls and they follow, but they refuse to follow a stranger because they do not know his voice (John 10:1-5). John desires that we know Jesus as the Son of God and believe in Him personally as the Good Shepherd. Third, \u201cvoice\u201d is dynamic in that it reflects the robust and powerful activity of a living God. It is historical in that any act of speaking comes to expression and takes place in the real world as a \u201cvoice\u201d calling, demanding a response. It challenges any notion that the Christian faith can be reduced to rules, propositions, or doctrines that can be merely believed or dismissed and not lived out in our lives. Since in Jesus God is speaking and revealing Himself to the world, and since in Jesus we hear the Voice of God, then this new reality changes everything so we, too, must change. In the beginning Before time itself was measured, the Voice was speaking. The Voice was and is God."

John rejects any messianic claim outright. Jesus, though, accepts it with a smile, but only from a few devoted followers\u2014at least at first. Of course John is crucial to the unfolding drama, but he isn\u2019t the long awaited One sent to free His people. He preaches repentance and tells everybody to get ready for One greater to come along. The One who comes will cleanse humanity in fire and power, he says. John even urges some of his followers to leave him and go follow Jesus. The reputation of John was growing; and many had questions, including Jewish religious leaders from Jerusalem."
