Although mighty people occupy the lands, God tells the Israelites that the land will be theirs, if they only believe. Joshua is reminded often enough of the wanderings in the desert following Moses. It\u2019s an intimidating thing to follow a legend, but the charge God gives Joshua also gives him what he needs to succeed: Be strong and courageous, and keep the words of God always in front of you. If you do those things, then you can\u2019t go wrong. And if you do those things, God says He will be with you. When Joshua had heard God\u2019s commands, he gathered the leaders of the people of Israel and gave them their instructions."
