While this song is certainly the longest libretto in the Bible, it is not the only one. The Book of Psalms is replete with them; and they often open with directions for musical instruments such as in Psalm 4, which begins, \u201cFor the worship leader. A song of David accompanied by strings.\u201d Song of Songs lacks such instrumental direction; but through the poetic phrasing and pronoun usage, three distinct vocal parts are inherently identifiable: the female lover (who would sing soprano), the male lover (who would sing tenor), and the observing young women (who would function as the chorus). Even without the musical score, it is possible to imagine these actors breathing life into the libretto on a great stage. For Solomon. The most sublime song of all."

Two of the most common images are that of the gazelle and the lotus blossom (translated here as \u201clily\u201d), both frequently used in many ancient Near Eastern cultures. The gazelle is a species of antelope whose males have long horns. Both males and females move with grace and strength as they cross flat savannahs or climb steep cliffs. It is because of these traits that the gazelle is equated with sexuality, youth, and stamina. The Israelites used it in poetry to represent the youthful joys of love and sexual vigor, while many Near Eastern pagan religions used it in images honoring fertility goddesses. The lotus is a type of lily found in watery regions. Because of its shape, which resembles the womb, and its fragrance, which is alluring, the lotus became the flower of choice for lovers across the Near East. In Israel it was featured in poetry and even dominated the capitals of the columns supporting Solomon\u2019s temple; in Egyptian and Phoenician cultures, it represented the gods themselves. With just one word, \u201cgazelle\u201d or \u201clotus,\u201d this poet conveys a bevy of ideas about love, youth, strength, and passion. I pulled him to me and would not let him go until I brought him to my mother\u2019s house, to the very room where she conceived me."

This image would have been particularly meaningful in ancient Israelite society, where life was centered on familial relationships and calling someone \u201cbrother\u201d or \u201csister\u201d was a sign of deep intimacy and care. Blood relatives lived together, worked together, traded with each other, and were buried together. By calling the woman \u201csister,\u201d he is declaring they are now blood relatives. In the covenant relationship called marriage, blood is drawn during consummation, bonding the two parties together as man and wife, as brother and sister, forever. Him (to the winds): Rise, you north wind; come, you south wind. Breathe on my garden, and let the fragrance of its natural spices fill the air.

There it is narrated that Eve is to have desire for her husband who will rule over her. What the woman has said here is the exact opposite of the post-sin marriage structure: it is the man who desires the woman. Therefore, the depiction of the marriage relationship in Song of Songs gives a glimpse of what marriage might have looked like prior to the first sin in Eden. God designed the relationship between husband and wife to be one of love, passion, and pleasure. This should be the ideal all couples strive for in their marriages as they work together to avoid sin in their lives. Her (to him): If only you were like my brother, my love, nursed at my mother\u2019s breast! Then we could show our affection in public. I would kiss you, and no one would think anything of it.
