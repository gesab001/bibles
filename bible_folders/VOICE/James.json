Wisdom begins with knowing and depending absolutely on God, who is never stingy when it comes to wisdom for those who seek it. He supplies all the wisdom we need when we ask. But when we try to go it alone\u2014without God\u2014trouble is around the corner. The key is that your request be anchored by your single-minded commitment to God. Those who depend only on their own judgment are like those lost on the seas, carried away by any wave or picked up by any wind."

God often chooses those who are the poorest materially to be the richest spiritually. We should welcome everyone equally into God\u2019s kingdom, even if it means upsetting boundaries like class and race. The rule is simple: we should treat others in the same way we want to be treated. God does not play favorites, and neither should we.

On the one hand, it appears James is saying that salvation is achieved by works; on the other, writers such as Paul emphasize that salvation comes by faith alone, not works of the law (Galatians 2). Look carefully and you\u2019ll see that Paul and James are talking about different issues. Paul is in the middle of a debate with Jewish Christians over whether Gentiles must live like Jews to enter the family of faith. He says that no one is made right with God by performing the works of the law. Instead, all people are made right by faith, thanks to God\u2019s grace. For James the situation is entirely different. The works he is talking about refer to God\u2019s people helping the poor, not whether non-Jews must live like Jews. He\u2019s concerned about a shallow, insincere, and hypocritical faith. Paul describes the root of salvation; a person is saved by God\u2019s grace received through faith. James is explaining the fruit of salvation; saving faith is a faith that works. Brothers and sisters, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to say you have faith and act in a way that denies that faith. Mere talk never gets you very far, and a commitment to Jesus only in words will not save you."
