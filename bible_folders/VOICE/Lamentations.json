For generations they have ignored the warnings and continued in idolatry, dependence upon foreign powers, and oppression of the less fortunate. Yes, the sacrifices in the temple have continued, but they have continually turned away from God. One prophet after another has called them back to a life of trust in the Lord, but they still look to others for assurance. Time has run out. Jabbing and fondling, mauling all her treasures, the enemy takes stock. Foreign nations enter even her holy place, claiming what You decided was off-limits And forbidden to them\u2014Your temple."

When Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to Jerusalem in the early sixth century B.C., he did not allow any food or provision to enter the city; he literally waited for God\u2019s people in Jerusalem to starve to death. As the executioner of God\u2019s judgment, Nebuchadnezzar punished everyone equally, regardless of the severity of his or her sins, because all sin is worthy of death. The people in Jerusalem really experienced God\u2019s dark cloud and His frowning countenance. Kindling a fire, the Eternal attacked Zion until nothing was left\u2014not even the foundations. His anger was poured out as that angry fire consuming all."
