God hates divorce because of its disastrous consequences on lives, families, and communities. The effects of broken marriages can last a lifetime, even if people fool themselves into thinking otherwise. God stands as the first and most important witness to every marriage contract, and He desires for His people to take those vows seriously. On another level, however, God is rebuking all of Israel\u2014His bride\u2014who has committed adultery against the Eternal One by abandoning Him to worship other gods. As chronic adulterers, God\u2019s people don\u2019t realize their illicit relationships with pagan goddesses and foreign governments have broken their covenant with Him and are causing them to stray from God\u2019s requirements. They mix cultic rituals with God\u2019s prescribed rituals, and they genuinely don\u2019t understand why God won\u2019t respond to their prayers, blessings, and sacrifices. Israel demonstrates how people can become insensitive to frequent sin and how that sin can affect their contemporaries and future generations. According to the prophet, naivet\u00e9 is no excuse for breaking His commands. Eternal One: If you will not listen and if you will not devote yourselves to giving glory to My name, then I, the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, will send the curse on you and will curse those blessings you give to Me on behalf of yourselves and your laypeople. In fact, I have cursed those blessings since you are refusing to dedicate yourselves to Me."

These verses simultaneously display retrospective and prospective dimensions of Malachi\u2019s conversation with the people, especially the temple priests, of Jerusalem. Malachi calls his contemporaries to remember the life and message of Moses and future generations to look forward to the life and message of the Elijah who is to come. As Ezra in the fifth century B.C. is like Elijah, reflecting these expectations, so John the Baptist is the messenger par excellence 400 years later when he prepares the world for Jesus of Nazareth, God\u2019s Anointed One."
