Surely they are filled with joy, curiosity, and amazement as His followers hang on His every word and gaze on the reality of His bodily resurrection as He describes the kingdom of God. His words are undoubtedly intended to prepare each of them for this journey, a journey with a clear destination in sight\u2014the kingdom of God. An integral part of this kingdom is the activity of the Holy Spirit to empower the people of God as they expand the kingdom beyond the region of Palestine. Luke records surprisingly little about the day-to-day life of these early Christians, about how they integrated their faith into their culture; but he does emphasize the work of the Spirit who empowers miracles and gives believers the means to testify of their faith before Jews and the outsiders. To a lover of God, Theophilus: In my first book, I recounted the events of Jesus\u2019 life\u2014His actions, His teachings\u2014"

How can they be truly unified as one church without being able to sit down together for a meal? This council affirms\u2014under the influence of the Spirit\u2019s work\u2014that the outsiders may become Christians without becoming Jews first; but the outsiders should respect their Jewish brothers\u2019 beliefs so they can fellowship together. The decision is a model for church unity: artificial hurdles should not be imposed for inclusion, but groups should willingly sacrifice their freedoms to promote unity in the church. Peter: My brothers, you all know that in the early days of our movement, God decided that I should be the one through whom the first outsiders would hear the good news and become believers."

Paul has them hanging on to every word from his mouth, until he speaks of the outsiders. The crowd immediately rises from their silence into a furious rage. The message is clear\u2014if your revelation extends beyond our people, we will hear nothing of it. How could all of these students of the Hebrew Scriptures have been so ignorant about God\u2019s intentions to rescue all people? The prophets declared God\u2019s plan to offer grace to Jews and non-Jews, but no one in this crowd considered that good news. They were listening quietly up until he mentioned the outsiders.

The thing society opposes often defines it, so manipulation is easy. (Consider some of the conservative political pundits who have never espoused any inclination toward Christianity. They gain millions of Christian followers by opposing the political enemies of conservative Christians.) Paul embraces a similar strategy here\u2014if he can get these guys to fight, they will forget why they are actually convening. In many ways, the culture war is equally distracting to the early church. In the middle of the Jews vs. Gentiles battle, the church is realizing believers are not here to fight about morality and culture, but to bring the kingdom of God to earth. His kingdom will not come by debate, but by the working of the Holy Spirit within the church. Paul noticed that some members of the council were Sadducees and some were Pharisees, so he quickly spoke to the council. Paul: Brothers, I am a Pharisee, born to a Pharisee.

Other sources will recount how Paul is later martyred in Rome, a victim of Nero\u2019s paranoia and cruelty. But Luke\u2019s story isn\u2019t a biography of Paul; it is a narration about \u201cthe Way\u201d as it moved geographically and culturally from Jerusalem (at the edge of the empire) to Rome (the celebrated center of the world). Therefore, Luke\u2019s story finishes once the message of Jesus is spreading without hindrance. As it moves geographically, \u201cthe Way,\u201d as Jesus\u2019 followers preferred to call it, crosses cultural, linguistic, and religious boundaries. At each and every point, Luke assures, the Spirit is there demonstrating God\u2019s blessing on and approval of the emissaries who walk in the footsteps of Jesus and in fulfillment of prophecies. Clearly what happened in those early decades was driven by the Spirit-wind of heaven; and God\u2019s purposes are realized through the faithful obedience of disciples such as Peter, Stephen, Philip, and Paul. Luke\u2019s account has ended, but the story about the acts of God through the church continues into our day. We are the characters in the current volume of salvation history. Through our faithful obedience, also empowered by the Spirit-wind of heaven, our stories are part of the anthology of God\u2019s new creation. Jewish Leaders: We haven\u2019t received letters from Judea about you, and no visiting brother has reported anything or said anything negative about you."
