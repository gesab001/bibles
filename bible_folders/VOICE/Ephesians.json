But Paul is confident in the truth of the gospel. The truth is that salvation is God\u2019s gift through Jesus. Grace and faith make salvation real in us. When we are transformed by grace, then we become His new creation and begin to live out the good works He has planned for us. Works, then, aren\u2019t the cause of salvation; they are its result. To put it another way, works aren\u2019t the means of salvation; they are its presence. So never forget how you used to be. Those of you born as outsiders to Israel were outcasts, branded \u201cthe uncircumcised\u201d by those who bore the sign of the covenant in their flesh, a sign made with human hands."

Today walls continue to exist, erected strategically to separate people by race, religion, class, culture, and sex. Those who erect these walls, protect them, and maintain them will find that they are enemies of the gospel that brings all together into one worshiping family.
