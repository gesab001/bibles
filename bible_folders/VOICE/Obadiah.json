                    "verse": "Imagine the scene: The Edomites have come with other nations to rob and betray Israel; it looks as though God has allowed Israel\u2019s cousins, the descendants of Isaac through Esau, to steal from His temple and holy city. The Israelites are convinced they have kept Abraham\u2019s covenant with God while the Edomites have forsaken the Lord and His people Israel. Their prayer is for God to provide refuge for those who seek and trust in Him, and to judge their enemies. This is the vision that came to Obadiah: Listen carefully to what the Eternal Lord says about the nation of Edom. Learn from their fate. We have been put on notice through the Eternal\u2019s representative who was sent to everyone among the nations saying, \u201cGet up. Get ready to charge against Edom in battle.\u201d"

Even if you fly high as the eagle, believing yourselves strong and free, and put your nest among the stars, I will have no trouble bringing you down. This is declared by the Eternal One."
