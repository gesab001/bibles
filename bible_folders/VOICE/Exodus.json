It sometimes appears in books or translations as YHWH or Yahweh, but this is only a transliteration of the four letters in Hebrew; it\u2019s not a translation of its meaning. The name is built on the Hebrew verb \u201cto be\u201d and refers to the fact that God is the Self-existent One\u2014\u201cI AM WHO I AM.\u201d Many translations render the divine name \u201cLORD\u201d (in capital and small capital letters), but this translation uses \u201cthe Eternal One,\u201d for at the heart of the name is the notion that God has always been and always will be. God transcends time and existence; He is the ground of existence. Out of respect, the ancients would seldom speak or write the covenant name; they would use it only on the most solemn occasions. Still God is establishing a unique relationship with Abraham\u2019s descendants, and it is time to reveal to them His name.

But Moses\u2019 mission is something else entirely; it is God\u2019s business, involving promises made by a holy God to Abraham hundreds of years earlier, promises to provide for and protect His people. One key aspect of that covenant is the obligation of all males to be circumcised. Apparently Moses has neglected to circumcise his son, a fact that could jeopardize the entire mission. So when Zipporah realizes the gravity of the situation, she takes action and circumcises him. With their covenant responsibilities now met, Moses is free to continue the mission.

For over 400 years, God\u2019s covenant people lived as outsiders in Egypt. For as long as that last generation could remember, they had been slaves living embittered lives under a cruel regime. But God heard their cries and acted finally and decisively to rescue them. Now it is time to go home, to a land they have never seen, a land of promise and prosperity.

For centuries people have sought to explain this great miracle and make sense of it. Was it a volcanic eruption and a tsunami that parted the waters? Was it a shallow lake that drowned Pharaoh\u2019s army? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Only God knows. But reason cannot grasp all that took place that day. When God\u2019s covenant people were on the verge of extinction, God stepped in to fight for them. No one survived that day except by the miraculous grace of God. Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Eternal One. Moses and the Israelites: I will sing to the Eternal, for He has won a great victory; He has thrown the chariot into the sea: horse and rider."

The people are to honor their God by having days of pure rejoicing as they recall their rescue from Egypt and God\u2019s ongoing provision. In keeping with the needs of an agricultural people, these feasts are situated around the harvests: first, the collection of the winter grains; second, the harvest of the other grains 50 days later; third, the gathering of the main crops of the field.

These animals are the basis of their economy and provide them with food, clothing, shelter, and security. To offer God an animal sacrifice is to offer a piece of their lives. So offerings are very personal and differ based on what families can afford. In some cases, the sacrifices are completely consumed, but in others the priests and the people take some of the meat home to their own tables. This way the whole community shares in the bounty of the sacrifice. Eternal One: Take the meat of the ordination ram and boil it in a sacred place."

The amazing truth of all Scripture is reflected here: God resides in the midst of His people. In every detail of God\u2019s directives\u2014the ethical rules, the people\u2019s offerings, the design of the congregation tent and its furnishings, God\u2019s redemptive acts\u2014God is announcing the central truth: He is present with His covenant people. So the physical elements of this covenant bear witness to deep, spiritual realities. God is in the process of repairing the world from the damage caused by sin and death; but to do so, He needs a people. This is why He chooses Israel and makes them different from everyone else. He needs agents on the ground devoted to liberating a world held hostage to lesser powers and feebler gods. But where will those people be formed and trained to be God\u2019s effective agents? They will be shaped in the crucible of worship and obedience. Eternal One: When the first day of the first month arrives, erect the sanctuary of the congregation tent."
