The Philistine king wanted David and his men to fight for the Philistines against Israel because David was mighty in battle. But the king\u2019s generals convinced him that David could not be trusted, and an attack on his people sent David hurrying off in another direction just as the battle was joined between Israel and Philistia. In that battle, disaster struck: the army of Israel was routed. Saul fought bravely but was defeated, at last falling on his own sword rather than be captured, tortured, and exhibited as a prize; and Saul\u2019s son Jonathan, beloved friend of David, also died in the battle. The fall of the first royal house of Israel is complete, and now Israel faces grave danger. David: From where have you come? Soldier: I have come from the camp of Israel; I escaped after the battle."
