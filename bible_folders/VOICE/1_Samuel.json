And their selfish desires are often very wrong morally, socially, and personally. Israel is a dark place waiting for a light to enter, and as is usually the case in the story of the people of God, God has a plan. Elkanah used to go up every year from his city to worship and offer sacrifices at the altar of the Eternal One, Commander of heavenly armies, at Shiloh, where the priests of the Eternal were Eli\u2019s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas."

The underlying message of the books of Samuel is, as in many other places in the Bible, that faith and trust in God are more important than any trust we place in human beings\u2014even powerful human beings. Hannah\u2019s prayers for a child, her absolute faith in God\u2019s plan, and her willingness to be a part of it however she can, resonate as the kings and warriors begin to enter the stage. Without her faith, there can be no story. Elkanah (seeing Hannah\u2019s despair): Why are you crying and not eating? Why are you so sad, Hannah? Don\u2019t I love you more than any 10 sons could?"

More contemporary theologians suggest that God can change His mind as His purpose is being worked out through the actions of human beings. In either case, what we see here is God seeking someone who will act as His regent and do exactly as He says\u2014and clearly, Saul is no longer capable of being that person.

The army of Israel wins a great victory over the panicked Philistines after David strikes down their champion, and David is elevated in the eyes of all (and soon will become Saul\u2019s leading general). But the seeds of the ongoing struggle between Saul and David are also sown on this day, as the people celebrate the good-looking boy\u2019s valor and heroism, filling Saul with jealousy. Soon Saul is thinking that David has everything but the kingdom\u2019s throne, and he turns on the boy who has saved his people. Their war destroys Saul and complicates David\u2019s life and eventual rule. Then David ran to the Philistine and stood over his lifeless body. He pulled the man\u2019s sword from its scabbard and finished him by cutting off his head. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they knew they would be next, so they ran away."

It would be nothing more than self-defense. Wouldn\u2019t Saul kill David if Saul caught him with his pants down? Isn\u2019t Saul turning over every stone in the wilderness looking for David so he can kill him? David settles for a symbolic victory\u2014he cuts off a corner of Saul\u2019s robe while Saul is otherwise occupied\u2014but then he feels ashamed. If David is supposed to be king someday, God will make that happen. But until that time, who is he to bring shame on the king whom God anointed as his ruler? The exchange between David and Saul shows both men at their best. At times, David could be a schemer; Saul\u2019s obsession and possible mental illness could obscure the good qualities that caused God to choose him in the first place. But in this exchange, each acknowledges the other. Saul sees that David could have killed him and chose not to; for the moment, he sees the truth about their relationship. In return Saul acknowledges what he knows in his heart to be true: David will someday be the king, and not he or his sons. And as Eli did earlier, Saul here accepts God\u2019s plan, even though it will be the destruction of his line. Saul doesn\u2019t always keep this understanding, and he will pursue David again. But Saul has his good\u2014even noble\u2014qualities, especially as his time grows short. David\u2019s Men: This must be the very day the Eternal One told you about: \u201cWatch! I will give your enemy to you, and you will do whatever you please with him.\u201d David crept forward quietly and moved in so close he was able to cut a corner from Saul\u2019s robe."

At the beginning of his reign, Saul gathers a huge army to fight the Ammonites, who threaten to blind the men of Jabesh-gilead. Many years later, the people of the country hear what has happened. They raise an army of their own, march all night into the Philistine town of Beth-shan, and without regard to the danger, take down the bodies and return to their own country to give Saul and his family a decent and respectful burial. Saul is many things\u2014a brute, a coward, a prince, a warrior, a faithful follower, a faithless wallower\u2014and now he is dead. Some might celebrate; others mourn him. The king the people asked for has been dethroned, and the kingdom lies open to invasion, but God\u2019s plan is still operating. In the Second Book of Samuel, it is evident this is part of a larger order. The people\u2019s king has been defeated, but God\u2019s king is on his way. The deaths of Saul and his sons conclude the First Book of Samuel. God\u2019s anointed dies, and the armies of Israel are defeated. Some commentators, even though they may condemn suicide, do not fault Saul for falling on his own sword. Remembering how the Philistines blinded and tormented the hero and judge Samson, Saul knows his fate is torture and abuse. Not only does he not want to suffer that as a man, but also as God\u2019s anointed king, he does not want these \u201cuncircumcised dogs\u201d\u2014that is, followers of other gods\u2014to claim such an advantage over the Lord. So he falls on his sword, and the Philistines, prevented from their torture, behead Saul\u2019s body, strip him, and exhibit his and his sons\u2019 corpses in public. When the people of Israel who were on the other side of the valley, and even those beyond the Jordan River, learned that the Israelite army had been defeated and heard that Saul and his sons were dead, they left their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came and lived in them."
