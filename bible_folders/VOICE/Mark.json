                    "verse": "When Mark writes in the first chapter about a mysterious man entering the scene, instantly the reader recognizes there\u2019s something very different about Jesus. He comes into the picture not as a rock star but rather as someone humble, kind, and yet, still kingly. Mark describes the people who are drawn toward this man as regular people who have become affected by the character, passion, and light of this strange Galilean. Maybe that\u2019s why Mark jumps right into the action of Jesus\u2019 story. He offers little by way of introduction. He writes nothing about Jesus\u2019 family tree. Unlike Matthew and Luke, he doesn\u2019t mention His birth. Mark\u2019s retelling begins with Scripture and the preaching of John the Baptist who calls people to repent. Like all the greats of history, Jesus doesn\u2019t just arrive\u2014He is announced\u2014and who better than John to do that? Right before Jesus makes His entrance into Mark\u2019s narrative, John says, \u201cI\u2019ve washed you here with water, but when He gets here, He will wash you in the Spirit of God.\u201d This is the beginning of the good news of Jesus, the Anointed One, the Liberating King, the Son of God."

On their journey through the wilderness to the promised land, the Israelites walked across the Jordan River on dry ground because God parted its waters. Elisha, one of the prophets of God, healed Naaman by telling him to bathe seven times in its waters. Partly because of miracles like these and partly because of a growing wilderness spirituality, many of the Jews in John\u2019s day are out to hear him and be ritually baptized in the Jordan\u2019s cool, cleansing waters. They are looking for God to intervene miraculously in their lives as He has done in the past. What they don\u2019t know is that God is about to intervene, for at that time Jesus leaves Nazareth and heads south. It was in those days that Jesus left Nazareth (a village in the region of Galilee) and came down to the Jordan, and John cleansed Him through baptism there in the same way all the others were ritually cleansed."

However, this miracle\u2014the healing of the blind man\u2014is the only miracle in all the Gospels that is done in stages instead of instantly. Of course, there\u2019s no way to know for sure why Jesus chooses to heal this man partly before He heals him entirely. Jesus frequently links faith, or lack of faith, with the healings. Bethsaida is a town He criticizes for its lack of faith (Matthew 11:21\u201322). So it\u2019s likely He wants to demonstrate to His disciples that their inability to see His purpose can be healed, too, even if it takes time. As He traveled with His disciples into the villages of Caesarea Philippi, He posed an important question to them. Jesus: Who do the people say that I am?"
