In Hebrew Psalm 10 is a continuation of Psalm 9 because it was composed as an acrostic poem. Likewise, many Hebrew manuscripts combine Psalm 33 with 32. Only later are these divided into separate psalms. Psalm 1 sets the stage for the entire collection by explaining that the study of the Word of God is the foundation of a meaningful, prosperous life. Psalm 1 - God\u2019s blessings follow you and await you at every turn: when you don\u2019t follow the advice of those who delight in wicked schemes, When you avoid sin\u2019s highway, when judgment and sarcasm beckon you, but you refuse."

The various psalms reflect nearly every human emotion: unbridled joy, deep-seated jealousy, seething anger, hope, and depression. These are only a few of the emotions behind the poetry we hear expressed in individual psalms. Feelings and emotions are central to what it means to be human. We cannot escape them nor should we. Psalms invites us to take the emotions we feel and bring them before God. This book models how to come before God in times of sadness, brokenness, and joy. Psalm 5 is a cry for help and a plea for guidance by a person who suffered at the hands of an enemy. It talks about the morning as the time to pray and listen for God to answer. Like many laments, it begins with a cry but ends in confidence. Bend Your ear to me and listen to my words, O Eternal One; hear the deep cry of my heart."

This literary device has several functions. First, it provides a mnemonic device for easier memorization. Second, it is inherently beautiful; the rigid structure is a showcase for the author\u2019s literary talents. Finally, it conveys the idea of completion by describing the reasons God is to be praised \u201cfrom A to Z.\u201d Psalm 9 offers David\u2019s thanks and praise to God for defeating his enemies. Psalm 10, on the other hand, is a lament complaining that God is far off while the poor and helpless suffer. All my heart will give thanks to You, Eternal One.

But the long-lasting appeal of Psalm 23 is a direct result of that casting because the imagery is both soothing and accessible. When he was a boy, King David was a shepherd watching his father\u2019s flocks in the hills around Bethlehem. In those days, too, it was common to refer to kings in the Near East as shepherds; but not all shepherd-kings cared for their sheep. Though David tried to shepherd his people well, he knew the truth: the Eternal is the true Shepherd. In John 10:11 Jesus makes a bold claim. He declares that He is the good shepherd. Immediately His disciples detected the resonance of Psalm 23 in His words. Those of us who follow Jesus today come to know Him as that gentle but strong shepherd who guides us through life if we will follow Him. The Eternal is my shepherd, He cares for me always."

                    "verse": "Book Two - This second book of psalms (Psalms 42\u201372) has a few unique features. First, it is the only book of the five that contains psalms ascribed to the sons of Korah, a group of Levite temple singers. Second, it uses two rather obscure Hebrew terms in the superscriptions of almost half of these psalms. Maskil, which may be related to contemplation, is translated \u201ccontemplative poem\u201d or \u201csong\u201d (42; 44\u201345; 52\u201355) and miktam, whose meaning is unclear, is translated \u201ca prayer\u201d (56\u201360). Third, in referring to God this second book shows a preference for the word \u201cGod\u201d over the name \u201cthe Eternal One\u201d that appears as \u201cYHWH\u201d in the Hebrew Scriptures. Throughout the Bible, the creator and covenant God is referred to in many ways. Generally speaking, the names and titles used indicate something of His character and nature. The title \u201cGod\u201d implies His unique majesty and power; no one is like Him. The name, translated \u201cThe Eternal One\u201d and also \u201cThe Eternal,\u201d is God\u2019s covenant name revealed uniquely to Israel. As the translation suggests, the divine name implies that the one True God transcends time and yet He is \u201cwith\u201d His people. Psalm 42 - For the worship leader. A contemplative song of the sons of Korah. My soul is dry and thirsts for You, True God, as a deer thirsts for water."

This is why Scripture instructs those of faith to pray for all people everywhere, especially that those in authority would lead the world to dignity and peace (1 Timothy 2:1-3). Psalm 45 celebrates that rare breed, a godly king who pursues truth and justice. It anticipates a joyful union and future children who will one day follow in the steps of their father.

One of the most difficult episodes in King David\u2019s life was his affair with Bathsheba and all that resulted from it. Psalm 51 reflects the emotions he felt after Nathan confronted him with stealing Bathsheba and murdering her husband, Uriah (2 Samuel 11\u201312). At one time or another, all people experience the painful consequences of sin. Psalm 51 has been a comfort and a help to millions who have prayed these words as their own. It invites all who are broken to come before God and lean upon His compassion. It teaches that we need not only to be forgiven for the wrong we have done, but we also need to be cleansed of its effects on us. Ultimately, it helps us recognize that if we are to be healed, it is the work of God to create in us a heart that is clean and a spirit that is strong. Look on me with a heart of mercy, O God, according to Your generous love. According to Your great compassion, wipe out every consequence of my shameful crimes."

Psalm 2, one of the introductory psalms, describes the king as the son of God, the ruler of nations, and the anointed one. During the monarchical period in Israel, psalms like these were tied to the kings themselves, idealizing them as perfectly just and righteous and victorious. But during the exile, God\u2019s exiled people longed for freedom and the implications of these songs began to change. Many Jews began to interpret these psalms as referring to a coming ruler, a Davidic king who would usher in an eternal kingdom and perfect peace. This hope was realized in Jesus. So this is why the earliest followers of Jesus went back to the psalms again and again. They found within many of the psalms, the story of Jesus anticipated and celebrated. And may those who live in the city bloom and flourish just as the grass of the fields and meadows."

He was a Levite musician appointed by David to lead the worship that surrounded the covenant chest in the congregation tent (1 Chronicles 16:4\u20136). Asaph and his descendants continued this work through much of Israel\u2019s history, specifically when Solomon dedicated the temple (2 Chronicles 5:12), when Josiah revived the worship of the Eternal One in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 35:15), and when Ezra and Nehemiah dedicated the wall around Jerusalem (Nehemiah 12:35). The psalms attributed to Asaph were liturgical, that is, they were chanted or sung as a part of the regular worship of God in the temple by the priests, Levites, and perhaps other worshipers too. Whether songs of lament, requests for guidance, or pleas for mercy, these psalms were sung in the one place God would hear them best\u2014at His temple\u2014the nexus between heaven and earth.

Second, they beg Him for help and express trust that He will answer them, often remembering how He has saved Israel in the past. Finally, the singers promise to praise God once He has resolved their problem. The specifics of the situation determine the thrust of the song. Communal laments are often the people\u2019s poetic and practical response to their perception of God\u2019s inaction in their affairs. How long can this go on, O Eternal One?

The psalm provides the answer. Not only has God created us\u2014a gracious act of love in and of itself\u2014but He has made us His own people. He has chosen us and loved us. As with Psalm 23, God\u2019s people are cast in the role as sheep living well in His pasture. The psalm ends on a high note of confidence and hope. At all times\u2014but perhaps more in times of difficulty\u2014we need to be reminded of what is true. Regardless of what seems to be happening around us, the Eternal is good; His love and faithfulness will endure forever. Raise your voices; make a beautiful noise to the Eternal, all the earth."

After the Levites chanted a marvelous psalm, the people responded in praise to the Eternal (1 Chronicles 16:36).

It tracks along Israel\u2019s history as God\u2019s nation, from the united monarchy, through the exile, to the restoration. Psalm 107 is a song of thanksgiving composed by those who survived exile and made their way home. As in Isaiah, the return from exile is described as a new exodus. Three Davidic psalms toward the beginning of Book Five represent the monarchy and recall Israel\u2019s golden age. The Songs for the Journey to Worship (Psalm 120\u2013134) are composed for use by God\u2019s people as they traveled from their homes up to Zion to worship God at the temple. Representing their time in exile are songs of lament, heartbreaking testimonies to individuals\u2019 pain when they are crushed by their enemies and separated from God\u2019s blessings. Finally, Book Five concludes the collection by offering praise and thanks to God, for the story of Israel does not end with its exile and separation; rather, it ends in restoration and hope. Those who edited and compiled the Book of Psalms were relieved to be back in the land of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\u2014rebuilding their temple and reestablishing their connection with God. Psalm 107 - Erupt with thanks to the Eternal, for He is good and His loyal love lasts forever."

But the royal son is to be more than a king, he is to be a priest according the order of that mysterious and enigmatic figure, Melchizedek (Genesis 14:17-24). God promises to give this royal priest-king victory over his enemies as he marches out to war. This psalm is the psalm most quoted by early Christian writers in the New Testament. As they considered the significance of Jesus, they found that this psalm, more than any, expressed their conviction that the risen Jesus now occupies a unique place at God\u2019s right hand and will be victorious over His enemies. The Eternal said to my lord, \u201cSit here at My right hand, in the place of honor and power, And I will gather your enemies together, lead them in on hands and knees; you will rest your feet on their backs.\u201d"

You see, God not only called Israel to be His people and gave them a wonderful land, but He gave them a blueprint for living. The Hebrew word for that is torah, sometimes translated \u201claw\u201d or \u201cteachings.\u201d In torah God tells them how to structure their lives and communities so that they will live long, prosperous lives in the land He has given them. As you read through the psalm, you will notice words like law, teachings, precepts, word, decrees, and commands. Each of these words is a synonym highlighting some attribute of God\u2019s instructions to His people. Another memorable feature of this psalm is its form. The psalmist constructs this hymn as an elaborate acrostic poem that moves artfully through each letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Essentially, all the elements of this psalm combine to emphasize the importance of God\u2019s Word to His people, to the praise and glory of the one True God. Aleph Happy are the people who walk with integrity, who live according to the teachings of the Eternal."

The Songs for the Journey to Worship (Psalms 120\u2013134) celebrate the journey to Jerusalem to worship in God\u2019s temple. Centuries before these psalms were composed, the Lord chose to make His earthly home on Mount Zion in Jerusalem and directed David\u2019s son to build His house. King Solomon built the first temple and dedicated it to God in an elaborate ceremony that brought Israel together on the holy mountain (1 Kings 8). Now, clearly, the wise king believed that the one True God was present everywhere in the world, but he knew that Jerusalem was a special place, a sacred space picked by God. Solomon understood what we seem to have forgotten: those created in God\u2019s image long to encounter God in His holiness. And if we try to make every place holy, then no place is holy because holy means \u201cset apart,\u201d \u201cdistinct,\u201d \u201cspecial.\u201d So we need sacredness in our lives: sacred times, places, and people in our search for wholeness, for shalom. For centuries God\u2019s faithful people of the first and second covenants have gone on pilgrimages to the Holy Land and Jerusalem. Often these songs have gone with them, for they desire to draw close to God and to walk in the steps of those who have passed the faith along. When I was in deep trouble, I called out to the Eternal, and He answered my call."

Consider what it must have looked and sounded like in those days: voices lifted, shouting for joy, trumpets blaring, stringed instruments playing, people dancing, pipes humming, tambourines keeping rhythm, cymbals crashing. There are times when worship ought to break out in joy. Is it possible that our worship is too quiet, too reserved, too structured? Praise the Eternal! Praise the True God inside His temple. Praise Him beneath massive skies, under moonlit stars and rising sun."

This doxology not only closes Book Five, but it also closes the entire Book of Psalms. Up until now, the songs in this book have reminded us of all the reasons we should praise God. Some songs have even commanded us to praise Him. But this closing remark takes the command to praise one step further: everything alive\u2014humans, animals, and heaven\u2019s creatures\u2014must praise Him. Praise is what God created us to do; it is one of our highest purposes in life. So it is no wonder that the longest book of the Bible is purely devoted to helping us do just that."
