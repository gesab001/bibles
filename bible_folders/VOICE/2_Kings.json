Mesha has fortified the entire country, building a temple, palace, walls, and reservoirs. Most importantly, he fortifies the northern entrance to Moab, so Israel is forced to find another way to attack. Unfortunately, the only other option is for Israel to enter from the south, and that requires marching through Judah and Edom, something that would be perceived as an act of war. By securing Judah\u2019s and Edom\u2019s cooperation in the attack, Israel does not have to worry about being attacked while traveling through their nations, and she gains allies against the impressively strong Moab. Israel\u2019s king traveled with Judah\u2019s king and Edom\u2019s king. It was a difficult trip that lasted for seven days, a circular route around the territory held by Moab. By then there wasn\u2019t any water for the army or for the livestock."

Mesha\u2019s action gives his army courage to fight, but it is the military engagement that saves his nation. Moab defeats Israel and her allies.

The introduction of the figure Ben-hadad (meaning \u201cson of Hadad,\u201d who is the central Syrian god) is pivotal for the rest of the stories of Elisha and Israel. The Eternal uses Syria (also called Aram) as an instrument of divine punishment for Israel\u2019s sins. Ultimately in 732 B.C., Damascus and Syria fall under the hand of Tiglath-Pileser III. The city of Samaria and the Northern Kingdom are conquered just 10 years later. Israel\u2019s king had the table set and offered the Arameans a great feast. After they ate and drank, Israel\u2019s king told them to leave. They returned to their own master, and the Arameans stopped sending raiding parties into Israel."

When Assyria exiles the northern Israelites all over the empire, those ten tribes are lost.

Without that connection to Him, there is no one to save them."
