This serves three purposes: it gives the government an unending supply of capable people; it further cripples the conquered nation, rendering them helpless; and it ensures the conquered nation will not want to retaliate because their own loved ones live in the conquering land. Daniel and his friends are among these deportees. When they arrive in Babylonia, they are expected to assimilate to the Babylonian way of life; this includes changing their names. Nebuchadnezzar renames the deportees to complete their conversion to the Babylonian society and to demonstrate his status as their master. Although the king ate only the finest Babylonian fare, Daniel was determined not to violate God\u2019s law and defile himself by eating the food and drinking the wine that came from the king\u2019s table; so he asked the chief of the royal eunuchs for permission not to eat the food."

They also want to exclude any wines or mead because they intend to avoid any unnecessary entanglements with Babylonian culture. Most of those meats and wines have been offered to the Babylonian gods, and Daniel wants no part of that. Daniel and his exiled friends may have to live in Babylon, but they don\u2019t have to be absorbed into the culture. Every bite of every meal reminds them that they are different.

                    "verse": "The beasts can be identified by a careful study of history. The lion, bear, leopard, and fourth terrifying beast represent Babylon, Media, Persia, and Greece. Persia had four kings, so the leopard had four heads. The ten horns of the fourth beast with iron teeth represent the ten dominant Seleucid kings after Alexander the Great\u2019s empire splintered into four regions. The smaller horn is Antiochus IV who put down three potential Seleucid leaders (horns) before him. Just because a prophecy has been fulfilled once, it doesn\u2019t mean the prophecy is no longer instructive. Daniel\u2019s prophecies are excellent examples of this idea. Written from the perspective of the Babylonian exile, these prophecies describe the coming suffering of God\u2019s people under foreign rule and look forward to a time when God will liberate them. During the next 300 years, the Jews watch Daniel\u2019s prophecies unfold. The Persian Empire is conquered by a Greek, Alexander the Great, in 333 B.C. Alexander\u2019s short reign is followed by the division of the empire into four districts governed by his politically inexperienced generals; Israel is ruled by a string of cruel men\u2014culminating in the reign of Antiochus IV who attempts to turn Jerusalem into a Greek city, bans the Torah, and even builds an altar to Zeus in God\u2019s temple. In the face of such pagan influence, God instigates the Maccabean Revolt of 167-165 B.C. At that time, Jerusalem\u2019s God-fearing traditions return, and Israel is ruled by the Jews. But these historical facts are not the end of God\u2019s message. Within Daniel\u2019s prophecies is a description of the end of the age, a time when evil will be punished and the Liberator will reign. Daniel: I was intrigued with the 10 horns on the beast\u2019s head and that 11th horn that grew up and uprooted the other 3 horns, that horn with eyes like human eyes and a mouth that uttered arrogant words, that horn that looked greater than the rest."

Their collective failures to live up to the covenant they made with God has scattered the chosen people to the four corners of the earth and have brought ruin to Jerusalem. After reading the prophet Jeremiah, Daniel knows that the calamity will not be over until God\u2019s people come back to Him. With fasting and prayer, Daniel hopes to begin the process of restoration. God\u2019s covenant with Israel includes provisions for both blessings and curses. When the people follow God and keep His teaching, they can expect to live peacefully in the land God promised. But when the covenant people rebel against God and ignore His teaching, their actions\u2014or lack of actions\u2014bring into effect the curses. Daniel appeals to God\u2019s own interest as the One who cares about His name and His reputation. The fate of Jerusalem and His people reflects on Him. Now, Lord our God, You have made Your name great among the nations to this day by liberating Your enslaved people from the land of Egypt with powerful deeds; yet we have sinned against You, our Liberator, and we have acted wickedly."
