Demas, too, is drawn into the attractions of the world, while Alexander the coppersmith opposes their message. With so many who have abandoned and opposed Paul, it\u2019s refreshing to hear of Onesiphorus, who\u2014against all odds\u2014has stayed true to Paul and often visits him in prison to keep up his spirits. Clearly the message is that many may fall away, but a few will continue to be strong for the Lord. You may know by now that all those in Asia have turned their backs on me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes."
