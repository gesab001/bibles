The word \u201cangel\u201d literally means \u201cmessenger,\u201d and it can refer to either a human being or a heavenly being. The Hebrews author is writing about heavenly messengers. In the Bible, heavenly messengers have several functions\u2014executors of God\u2019s judgment, guardians of God\u2019s people, heralds of God\u2019s plans. They appear at critical moments to chosen people who play important roles in God\u2019s salvation, such as arriving to announce the birth and resurrection of Jesus and to transmit God\u2019s law to Moses. They are no more than messengers, created beings, who serve the will of God and His Son. Recognizing their place, they bow before the Son in loving adoration. For no heavenly messengers have ever heard God address them with these words of the psalms: You are My Son. Today I have become Your Father. Or heard Him promise, I will be to You a Father, and You will be My Son."

Then life happens and the invisible forces that shape culture in our world\u2014the idols of consumerism, relativism, and materialism\u2014begin their exacting work to shape us into an image that no longer reflects our Savior. Over and over again, the writer warns us to be careful. Don\u2019t neglect this great salvation. Make sure the anchor holds. Now clearly God didn\u2019t set up the heavenly messengers to bring the final word or to rule over the world that is coming."

In the Ten Commandments God commands His people to remember the Sabbath day, keep it holy, and do no work. By letting go of daily work, they declared their absolute dependence on God to meet their needs. We do not live by the work of our hands, but by the bread and Word that God supplies. But a greater rest is yet to come when we will be released from all suffering, and when we will inherit the earth. Jesus embodies this greater rest that still awaits the people of God, a people fashioned through obedience and faith. If some of us fail to enter that rest, it is because we fail to answer the call. So if God prepared a place of rest, and those who were given the good news didn\u2019t enter because they chose disobedience over faith, then it remains open for us to enter."

His task was profound, his duty dangerous: he must appear before God carrying the sins of his people. All the sins of Israel were concentrated in him as he carried the blood of the sacrifice into the divine presence. But there was another day, a Day of Atonement unlike any other, when Jesus concentrated in Himself the sins of the world, hanging on a cross not far from the temple\u2019s holiest chamber. Indeed, for a time, He became sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). But unlike the high priest, the crucified and risen Jesus entered the true temple of heaven and was ushered into the divine presence. At that moment, everything changed. Since what was given in the old covenant was the earthly sketch of the heavenly reality, this was sufficient to cleanse the earthly sanctuary; but in heaven, a more perfect sacrifice was needed."
