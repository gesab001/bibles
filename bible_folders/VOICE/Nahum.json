Descriptions of fantastic weather patterns demonstrate both the mysterious elusiveness and the mighty grandeur of God. Similar to the story related in Job 38, God visits the afflicted and impoverished through these images, and that impressive power He displays in His storms benefits the oppressed. Despite unspeakable horrors the Assyrians committed against the Israelites, His people still understand that their God is good. Futile are the plots you devise against the Eternal One, Nineveh, because He will put a stop to them. Evil will not have a second chance to rise up."

If showing the nakedness of the Assyrian people to the nations is not demoralizing enough, then the shame of God throwing excrement at His enemies is unmistakable. The indignity of being stripped naked and covered in filth is the fullest expression of God\u2019s rejection. While these images are disturbing, they are also typical of how powerful enemies, such as the armies of Nineveh, have treated their victims. Now the table is turned; the victor is now the victim. There is no one to comfort the Assyrian people: they are without a prophet; they are without a poet; they are without hope. Are you any stronger than the city of Thebes in its glory days? Sitting at the edge of the Nile, its waters created a moat of protection on one side of her. The Red Sea was a perfect defense against her eastern enemies, As good as the protection of a wall."
