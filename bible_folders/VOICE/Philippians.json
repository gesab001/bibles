It is an extended spiritual family where others line up to become part of this sacred assembly and to make it their home because they feel encouragement and know they are truly loved. So Paul urges the Philippians to strive for this radical unity and fulfill his joy by having the mind of Jesus who humbled Himself, became a servant, and suffered the death of the cross. Jesus becomes the example of humility and service, leading to the kind of unity Paul imagines. So now, my beloved, obey as you have always done, not only when I am with you, but even more so when I can\u2019t be. Continue to work out your salvation, with great fear and trembling,"

Some are teaching that non-Jews have to become Jews to follow Jesus completely, including circumcision, dietary regulations, keeping weekly and annual holy days, and other Jewish practices. Since the time of Abraham, circumcision has been the mark of the covenant with Abraham\u2019s spiritual children. Things are changing: outsiders, non-Jews, are entering into the new covenant. Do they enter by faith alone, or is it faith plus following God\u2019s law for Israel? Paul\u2019s answer is clear: it is faith alone that makes Jews and outsiders right with God. So he cautions the Philippians to watch out for those who would chastise them into a false circumcision. Real followers of Jesus know that salvation doesn\u2019t come from the blade of a knife but from His cross. We are the true circumcision\u2014those who worship God in Spirit and make our boast in Jesus the Anointed, the Liberating King\u2014so we do not rely on what we have accomplished in the flesh."
