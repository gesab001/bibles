He simply cannot dwell where holiness is not. He cannot make a larger-than-life Zion out of an earthly Jerusalem, unless that place (and its people, of course) are right. At best, these people seem to think that paying lip service to God is enough; at worst, they don\u2019t even care about God. A simple explanation is the people must be clean and holy. And this condition of rightness, holiness, and cleanliness is a product of how they are\u2014in relation not only to God, but also to each other and the very land itself; these things are inseparable. The consequences of their failure to ensure the holiness of this sacred place by being right with God, land, and others are dire indeed. God must cleanse His people and place because He determines to be represented within and by them. So, better days will come again, and His covenant people will be set right and be happy and prosperous again. See, this is what the Eternal told me. God leaned in close\u2014His strong hand on me\u2014to keep me from following these people."

Out of fear of Assyria and its brutal expansion west, Israel and Aram form an alliance and try to bully Judah and her king, Ahaz, into joining the futile confederation. But the prophet Isaiah holds a different opinion. He boldly instructs the king not to make any alliances or form any confederation as the Assyrian threat grows; instead, the prophet says, trust in God and God will protect you. But Israel and Aram attempt to force Judah into their alliance, unseating her king and replacing him with someone they can control. So Ahaz makes an alliance, not with Israel and Aram, but with their enemy, Assyria. When he asks for the empire\u2019s help, they eagerly agree. Although Assyria assists Ahaz in warding off one threat, Assyria itself constitutes an even greater threat as Judah will soon experience. Eternal One: So much for the \u201ccity of Damascus.\u201d It\u2019s done for. Soon it will be just a pile of rubble."

He addresses a series of burdensome messages to other cities, nations, and peoples. What is common to all of these prophecies is that God is angry with these nations for the harsh way they treat His covenant people, and He will not just let it go. So God has decided to punish them, and He warns his prophet ahead of time what is about to happen. This message is welcome news to the Judeans who suffered beneath the cruel tyranny of these foreign powers. On the one hand, God used Judah\u2019s enemies to accomplish His purpose.

Nothing could be more traumatic than to know that the temple to the one True God is under siege and finally destroyed. When Isaiah\u2019s words are heard, many audiences must think of a restored temple in Jerusalem. God Himself is promising to lay the foundation for that restored temple, assuring that those who trust in His work will never have to rush around again to figure out how to save themselves from another invader. God\u2019s foundation will hold firm, no matter what, so there is every reason to be confident. Early Christians see in Isaiah\u2019s message a promise of a new temple, a temple not made with hands. Simon, whom Jesus names \u201cRock\u201d (Peter), refers to this prophecy when he writes of believers coming to Jesus to form a spiritual house (1 Peter 2:6). Jesus\u2019 followers confess Him to be the stone that forms the foundation for God\u2019s new temple. He is the cornerstone: though rejected by some, He is chosen and precious in God\u2019s sight. O Ariel, woe to you Ariel, our Jerusalem, where David set up his camp to stay. Go ahead, go on with your fruitless festivals, your calendar of events, year in and year out."

As a king of David\u2019s royal line, Hezekiah\u2019s reign is anchored to a promise God made to King David hundreds of years earlier. Indeed Judah enjoyed some success, but now all seems uncertain. Not long before Hezekiah takes the throne in Jerusalem, Israel, his northern neighbor, succumbs to invaders from Assyria. Now more than 20 years later, the Assyrians are moving against Jerusalem and her king. With bullying words and intimidating tactics, the Rabshakeh tries to force the Judean king to surrender Jerusalem and its citizens. Ironically\u2014or perhaps providentially\u2014the place where Isaiah met Ahaz, Hezekiah\u2019s father, with God\u2019s message turns out to be near the place where the Rabshakeh now makes his demands upon Judah.

After all, the songs of praise never soar from death\u2019s dark realm. Those who go down into the pit\u2014that great black nothingness\u2014 Hezekiah becomes confident that God will restore his health and bring him back from the edge of death. Ironically, many years earlier his father Ahaz refused to ask for a sign even though God insisted that he do so. The son, it seems, has learned a valuable lesson; so he asks for a sign because he wants to know when he will be well enough to return to God\u2019s house and offer thanks to Him among the rest of his citizens. Unfortunately, with some people, it is only in the bitterness of disease and in death\u2019s dark shadow that a person learns to embrace life and live it to the fullest. Hezekiah\u2019s near-death experience embitters his soul, but it also moves him toward wholeness. What Hezekiah does not know is that the Babylonians have their eyes set on dominating the rest of the world. For years, the Assyrians and Babylonians have coexisted, but the Babylonians are not content to remain a regional power. As they build their empire\u2014annexing lands, conquering peoples, gaining strength\u2014they begin to take an interest in little Judah. Hezekiah doesn\u2019t account for how his actions might affect his nation. He simply isn\u2019t that shrewd. They can\u2019t even begin to hope for Your faithfulness."

Eventually the Southern Kingdom itself falls, not to Assyria but to Babylon. Shockingly, the Babylonians destroy the capital and raze the temple where the Holy One of Israel is uniquely present with the people. The Lord determines these events because their failings\u2014as Isaiah described in such detail\u2014and their refusal to correct their attitudes and behavior necessitate punishment on the order of national destruction. God\u2019s covenant people have broken their part of the agreement and be-come unfit to live as people of Zion. The scene has shifted. The situation has changed. The threat from Assyria now seems a distant memory. A new reality encompasses the people of God: Jerusalem and its glorious temple have been destroyed, and the key citizens of Judah have been carried off into exile by the Babylonians. While tradition credits the entire book to Isaiah of Jerusalem, many scholars think these next 16 chapters are recorded by another prophet years later in the spirit of that great prophet of Jerusalem who proclaimed much of the previous writings. Whether this was Isaiah speaking in the future prophetically or another person used by the Spirit to continue Isaiah\u2019s ministry, the traditions and ideas of Isaiah are so closely followed by the next chapters that they have been collected and included in this large book named after Isaiah. The time and circumstances are different, so the message is a bit different too. It is equally passionate about righteousness, Zion, and the Holy One of Israel. These events occur about two centuries after Isaiah\u2019s death in the land of exile\u2014Babylon. Isaiah: Listen well to what the Eternal, Commander of heavenly armies, has said:"

Yet at other times the Servant seems to be an individual, distinct from Israel, with a special mission to and for Israel. Early Christians hear these Servant Songs and reflect on Jesus\u2019 significance; they better understand His role as the light of the world, teacher, and Suffering Servant of God. They see His life and ministry as the embodiment and representative of true Israel and therefore the fulfillment of these words. They use the prophet\u2019s poetry to formulate songs and sermons that express not only Jesus\u2019 unique relationship to God but also His unique career as the Light of the world. Who is as blind as the one committed to do what the Eternal One wills, the servant of the Eternal?"

Human beings know at some deep, intuitive level that God exists, life is sacred, and there are mysteries more profound than the daily grind. This is why every human civilization exhibits some form of religious life and devotion. But instead of seeking the God who is, people have a tendency to create the gods they want, gods that give them control over the complexities and problems of life. Israel is elected by God for a number of reasons. Perhaps two of the most significant are to bear witness to the one True God and to warn the nations against idolatry. According to Scripture, idol worship is not some neutral, unfortunate habit people get themselves into; it is more than just a waste of time, hope, and effort. It is a dangerous substitute\u2014a counterfeit experience\u2014that adversely misshapes and disorders their lives. To persist in idolatry is to give way to malevolent evils and to miss out on a relationship with the one True God. But whoever does make an idol is not improved or enriched. On the contrary, their passing fancies contribute nothing of value or purpose. Those who look on at such misplaced attention don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re seeing, and the idol-makers will end up embarrassed at best."

The exile is receding in the past and the remnant of Israel\u2014those who survived God\u2019s judgment and Babylon\u2019s cruelty\u2014are working hard to rebuild their lives and communities. But life back in Jerusalem under Persian rule is not faring as well as they hoped. So once again a prophetic voice breaks the silence to address a discouraged population. Most people are facing terrific difficulties. Despite what their prophets have spoken, Jerusalem is a mere shadow of the great city their parents and grandparents knew. People doubt whether God is really alive, or really all that powerful, or really even cares. But the faithful know that God is powerful and does care; they are determined to convince their countrymen that He has their well-being in mind. He can make this people and this place great again, if they just trust and follow Him. Soon the whole world will be caught up in this brand new thing God is doing. This section of Isaiah is written to a singular female as if she is the mother of the Jews. But this woman isn\u2019t just any woman\u2014she is Jerusalem. Cities are often described as female because they are like mothers supporting a brood of children (the population). This capital city of God\u2019s special favor, of God\u2019s presence, is filled with His people of the promise and is poised to become something new and glorious. Arise, shine, for your light has broken through! The Eternal One\u2019s brilliance has dawned upon you."

But prophets like Isaiah and those who stand in the tradition of the great Hebrew prophets are also anointed. Living and working in Jerusalem in these days is much different than in earlier times. Wracked by the ages and ruined by overt destruction and covert neglect, the citizens of the holy city face disillusionment and disappointment. The people who come back after exile in Babylon do not return to a gloriously restored city and temple, but to a difficult land and contentious neighbors. The prophet is inspired by the spirit of God to restore hope, to help, and to comfort. As a spiritual guide he is compelled to convince people that God remains with them and that He still desires what is good, right, and true for and within them. Centuries later, in a synagogue in Nazareth, Jesus will pick up the scroll of Isaiah and read these inspiring words. He will say in no uncertain terms that the Scriptures are being fulfilled right then and there in their hearing (Luke 4:16-21). The year of jubilee will have arrived. The Eternal One will be all the light you ever need. Your God will provide your glory, brilliance for all time."

What does God want from us if not the best building we can build, and also the most and best sacrifices and rituals that we can possibly perform? Simply put, God is looking for people who are humble, broken, and ready to follow what He says. Eternal One: Whoever slaughters an ox without humility is no better than one who kills a man; Whoever sacrifices a lamb without brokenness is no different than one who breaks a dog\u2019s neck; Whoever presents a grain offering without fear is no different than one who offers pig\u2019s blood; Whoever burns incense without obedience is no better than one who worships an idol.

The destruction of Jerusalem and her glorious temple, the decades of exile in a foreign land, and now the return and restoration of Jerusalem are God\u2019s work, pure and simple. Now all of these events and judgments point to a single moment when Jerusalem will resume its place as God\u2019s chosen city and will open its gates to believing pilgrims. The prophet asks: will God prevent this new birth from happening? After having brought His people this far, it is unthinkable that God would turn back now. Eternal One: So be happy for Jerusalem; give her hearty congratulations, whoever holds her dear. Take part in this joyous celebration, especially if you remember her grief."

But now that God has announced the good news, mourning is no longer appropriate; it indicates a lack of faith in His plans. After enduring so many years of grief and desolation, can God\u2019s covenant people now turn and trust Him to deliver this baby overnight? Trust and joy belong together. Zion is like a fertile young woman; she will have all the children that God wills and she desires. Be happy, the prophet says, and let the celebrations begin. The Eternal\u2019s power will be clearly evident to His servants; but His rage will be unleashed against His enemies."
