But now they have the special congregation tent\u2014a complex, multilayered tent within an enclosed court, which they can take along on their journeys and set up anywhere. This is a holy place for the people of the Lord. It is the place for them to offer sacrifices; and inside this special tent, behind a heavy curtain, is the holiest place of all, where their spiritual leaders receive revelation from God. There are two Hebrew words used for this special place. One is literally \u201ctent\u201d while the other is \u201cdwelling.\u201d The word \u201ctent\u201d usually refers to the entire congregation tent, where any Israelite may come to the outer court and sacrifice. The word \u201cdwelling\u201d is used for that extra holy place or sanctuary behind the curtain, the residence of God or the place of His revelation where only certain priests were allowed. Now the people are ready to begin the preparation to move into the land promised to them by the Lord. First, He sets about organizing this enormous band of escaped slaves. Nearly two years after they had left Egypt, the Israelites were still in the wild desert area of Sinai. But on the first day of the second month, the Eternal One spoke to Moses in the tent of congregation."

The people griped about life in the wilderness, how hard they felt things were for them, and these evil complaints came up to the ears of the Eternal One.
