In contrast, Paul perceives the constant threat of false teaching that produces chaos, overturns entire families, and is filled with myths and instructions taught by those outside the faith. This counter-truth is filled with lusts and passions that tear down others, and it results in petty debates over family trees with fights and disagreements over the law. The line is clearly drawn between them. Paul leaves no room to sit on the fence; there is no partial truth\u2014the future of the church is at stake. We rest in this hope we\u2019ve been given\u2014the hope that we will live forever with our God\u2014the hope that He proclaimed ages and ages ago (even before time began). And our God is no liar; He is not even capable of uttering lies."
