Solomon addressed all Israel\u2014the commanders and captains, the judges, every leader, and all the heads of families. Then Solomon and the entire company went to the worship center at Gibeon\u2014that\u2019s where the Tent of Meeting of God was, the one that Moses the servant of GOD had made in the wilderness.
