All the offerings that were brought to The Temple of GOD were placed in the chest by the priests who guarded the entrance. When they saw that a large sum of money had accumulated in the chest, the king\u2019s secretary and the chief priest would empty the chest and count the offerings. They would give the money accounted for to the managers of The Temple project; they in turn would pay the carpenters, construction workers, masons, stoneworkers, and the buyers of timber and quarried stone for the repair and renovation of The Temple of GOD\u2014any expenses connected with fixing up The Temple. But none of the money brought into The Temple of GOD was used for liturgical \u201cextras\u201d (silver chalices, candle snuffers, trumpets, various gold and silver vessels, etc.). It was given to the workmen to pay for their repairing GOD\u2019s Temple. And no one even had to check on the men who handled the money given for the project\u2014they were honest men. Offerings designated for Compensation Offerings and Absolution Offerings didn\u2019t go into the building project\u2014those went directly to the priests."
