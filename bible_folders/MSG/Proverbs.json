It\u2019s the same when you have sex with your neighbor\u2019s wife: Touch her and you\u2019ll pay for it. No excuses. Hunger is no excuse for a thief to steal; When he\u2019s caught he has to pay it back, even if he has to put his whole house in hock. Adultery is a brainless act, soul-destroying, self-destructive; Expect a bloody nose, a black eye, and a reputation ruined for good.

Don\u2019t judge wine by its label, or its bouquet, or its full-bodied flavor. Judge it rather by the hangover it leaves you with\u2014 the splitting headache, the queasy stomach.

She makes her own clothing, and dresses in colorful linens and silks. Her husband is greatly respected when he deliberates with the city fathers. She designs gowns and sells them, brings the sweaters she knits to the dress shops. Her clothes are well-made and elegant, and she always faces tomorrow with a smile. When she speaks she has something worthwhile to say, and she always says it kindly. She keeps an eye on everyone in her household, and keeps them all busy and productive. Her children respect and bless her; her husband joins in with words of praise: \u201cMany women have done wonderful things, but you\u2019ve outclassed them all!\u201d Charm can mislead and beauty soon fades. The woman to be admired and praised is the woman who lives in the Fear-of-GOD. Give her everything she deserves! Adorn her life with praises!"
