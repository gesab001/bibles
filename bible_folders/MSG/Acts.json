After his death, he presented himself alive to them in many different settings over a period of forty days. In face-to-face meetings, he talked to them about things concerning the kingdom of God. As they met and ate meals together, he told them that they were on no account to leave Jerusalem but \u201cmust wait for what the Father promised: the promise you heard from me.

And Jason is hiding them, these traitors and turncoats who say Jesus is king and Caesar is nothing!\u201d"
