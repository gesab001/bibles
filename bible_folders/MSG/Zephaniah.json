At the same time, I\u2019ll get rid of all those who\u2019ve made your life miserable. I\u2019ll heal the maimed; I\u2019ll bring home the homeless. In the very countries where they were hated they will be venerated. On Judgment Day I\u2019ll bring you back home\u2014a great family gathering! You\u2019ll be famous and honored all over the world. You\u2019ll see it with your own eyes\u2014 all those painful partings turned into reunions!\u201d GOD\u2019s Promise."
