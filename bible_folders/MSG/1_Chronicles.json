There\u2019s none like you, GOD, no God but you, nothing to compare with what we\u2019ve heard with our own ears. And who is like your people, like Israel, a nation unique on earth, whom God set out to redeem as his own people (and became most famous for it), performing great and fearsome acts, throwing out nations and their gods left and right as you saved your people from Egypt? You established for yourself a people\u2014your very own Israel!\u2014your people forever. And you, GOD, became their God. So now, great GOD, this word that you have spoken to me and my family, guarantee it forever! Do exactly what you\u2019ve promised! Then your reputation will be confirmed and flourish always as people exclaim, \u201cThe GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies, the God over Israel, is Israel\u2019s God!\u201d And the house of your servant David will remain rock solid under your watchful presence. You, my God, have told me plainly, \u201cI will build you a house.\u201d That\u2019s how I was able to find the courage to pray this prayer to you. GOD, being the God you are, you have spoken all these wonderful words to me. As if that weren\u2019t enough, you\u2019ve blessed my family so that it will continue in your presence always.
