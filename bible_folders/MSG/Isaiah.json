Watch for this: A girl who is presently a virgin will get pregnant. She\u2019ll bear a son and name him Immanuel (God-With-Us). By the time the child is twelve years old, able to make moral decisions, the threat of war will be over. Relax, those two kings that have you so worried will be out of the picture. But also be warned: GOD will bring on you and your people and your government a judgment worse than anything since the time the kingdom split, when Ephraim left Judah.

Like a lion, God pummels and pounds me, relentlessly finishing me off. I squawk like a doomed hen, moan like a dove. My eyes ache from looking up for help: \u201cMaster, I\u2019m in trouble!

Do this and the lights will turn on, and your lives will turn around at once. Your righteousness will pave your way. The GOD of glory will secure your passage. Then when you pray, GOD will answer. You\u2019ll call out for help and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Here I am.\u2019 A Full Life in the Emptiest of Places - \u201cIf you get rid of unfair practices, quit blaming victims, quit gossiping about other people\u2019s sins, If you are generous with the hungry and start giving yourselves to the down-and-out, Your lives will begin to glow in the darkness, your shadowed lives will be bathed in sunlight. I will always show you where to go. I\u2019ll give you a full life in the emptiest of places\u2014 firm muscles, strong bones. You\u2019ll be like a well-watered garden, a gurgling spring that never runs dry. You\u2019ll use the old rubble of past lives to build anew, rebuild the foundations from out of your past. You\u2019ll be known as those who can fix anything, restore old ruins, rebuild and renovate, make the community livable again."

Justice is beaten back, Righteousness is banished to the sidelines, Truth staggers down the street, Honesty is nowhere to be found, Good is missing in action. Anyone renouncing evil is beaten and robbed. GOD looked and saw evil looming on the horizon\u2014 so much evil and no sign of Justice. He couldn\u2019t believe what he saw: not a soul around to correct this awful situation. So he did it himself, took on the work of Salvation, fueled by his own Righteousness. He dressed in Righteousness, put it on like a suit of armor, with Salvation on his head like a helmet, Put on Judgment like an overcoat, and threw a cloak of Passion across his shoulders. He\u2019ll make everyone pay for what they\u2019ve done: fury for his foes, just deserts for his enemies. Even the far-off islands will get paid off in full. In the west they\u2019ll fear the name of GOD, in the east they\u2019ll fear the glory of GOD, For he\u2019ll arrive like a river in flood stage, whipped to a torrent by the wind of GOD."

I\u2019ll send the survivors of judgment all over the world: Spain and Africa, Turkey and Greece, and the far-off islands that have never heard of me, who know nothing of what I\u2019ve done nor who I am. I\u2019ll send them out as missionaries to preach my glory among the nations. They\u2019ll return with all your long-lost brothers and sisters from all over the world. They\u2019ll bring them back and offer them in living worship to GOD. They\u2019ll bring them on horses and wagons and carts, on mules and camels, straight to my holy mountain Jerusalem,\u201d says GOD. \u201cThey\u2019ll present them just as Israelites present their offerings in a ceremonial vessel in the Temple of GOD. I\u2019ll even take some of them and make them priests and Levites,\u201d says GOD."
