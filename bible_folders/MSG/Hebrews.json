The days are coming when I\u2019ll set up a new plan for dealing with Israel and Judah. I\u2019ll throw out the old plan I set up with their ancestors when I led them by the hand out of Egypt. They didn\u2019t keep their part of the bargain, so I looked away and let it go. This new plan I\u2019m making with Israel isn\u2019t going to be written on paper, isn\u2019t going to be chiseled in stone; This time I\u2019m writing out the plan in them, carving it on the lining of their hearts. I\u2019ll be their God, they\u2019ll be my people. They won\u2019t go to school to learn about me, or buy a book called God in Five Easy Lessons. They\u2019ll all get to know me firsthand, the little and the big, the small and the great. They\u2019ll get to know me by being kindly forgiven, with the slate of their sins forever wiped clean. By coming up with a new plan, a new covenant between God and his people, God put the old plan on the shelf. And there it stays, gathering dust."
