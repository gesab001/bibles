He sent messengers to David saying, \u201cI\u2019m fighting at Rabbah, and I\u2019ve just captured the city\u2019s water supply. Hurry and get the rest of the troops together and set up camp here at the city and complete the capture yourself. Otherwise, I\u2019ll capture it and get all the credit instead of you.\u201d So David marshaled all the troops, went to Rabbah, and fought and captured it. He took the crown from their king\u2019s head\u2014very heavy with gold, and with a precious stone in it. It ended up on David\u2019s head. And they plundered the city, carrying off a great quantity of loot."
