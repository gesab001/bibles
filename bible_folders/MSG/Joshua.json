You are going to lead this people to inherit the land that I promised to give their ancestors. Give it everything you have, heart and soul. Make sure you carry out The Revelation that Moses commanded you, every bit of it. Don\u2019t get off track, either left or right, so as to make sure you get to where you\u2019re going.
