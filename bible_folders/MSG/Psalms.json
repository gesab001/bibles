He turned their harvest over to caterpillars, everything they had worked for to the locusts. He flattened their grapevines with hail; a killing frost ruined their orchards. He pounded their cattle with hail, let thunderbolts loose on their herds. His anger flared, a wild firestorm of havoc, An advance guard of disease-carrying angels to clear the ground, preparing the way before him. He didn\u2019t spare those people, he let the plague rage through their lives. He killed all the Egyptian firstborns, lusty infants, offspring of Ham\u2019s virility.

                    "verse": "O my soul, bless GOD! GOD, my God, how great you are! beautifully, gloriously robed, Dressed up in sunshine, and all heaven stretched out for your tent. You built your palace on the ocean deeps, made a chariot out of clouds and took off on wind-wings. You commandeered winds as messengers, appointed fire and flame as ambassadors. You set earth on a firm foundation so that nothing can shake it, ever. You blanketed earth with ocean, covered the mountains with deep waters; Then you roared and the water ran away\u2014 your thunder crash put it to flight. Mountains pushed up, valleys spread out in the places you assigned them. You set boundaries between earth and sea; never again will earth be flooded. You started the springs and rivers, sent them flowing among the hills. All the wild animals now drink their fill, wild donkeys quench their thirst. Along the riverbanks the birds build nests, ravens make their voices heard. You water the mountains from your heavenly reservoirs; earth is supplied with plenty of water. You make grass grow for the livestock, hay for the animals that plow the ground. Oh yes, God brings grain from the land, wine to make people happy, Their faces glowing with health, a people well-fed and hearty. GOD\u2019s trees are well-watered\u2014 the Lebanon cedars he planted. Birds build their nests in those trees; look\u2014the stork at home in the treetop. Mountain goats climb about the cliffs; badgers burrow among the rocks. The moon keeps track of the seasons, the sun is in charge of each day. When it\u2019s dark and night takes over, all the forest creatures come out. The young lions roar for their prey, clamoring to God for their supper. When the sun comes up, they vanish, lazily stretched out in their dens. Meanwhile, men and women go out to work, busy at their jobs until evening."

You built your palace on the ocean deeps, made a chariot out of clouds and took off on wind-wings. You commandeered winds as messengers, appointed fire and flame as ambassadors. You set earth on a firm foundation so that nothing can shake it, ever. You blanketed earth with ocean, covered the mountains with deep waters; Then you roared and the water ran away\u2014 your thunder crash put it to flight. Mountains pushed up, valleys spread out in the places you assigned them. You set boundaries between earth and sea; never again will earth be flooded. You started the springs and rivers, sent them flowing among the hills. All the wild animals now drink their fill, wild donkeys quench their thirst. Along the riverbanks the birds build nests, ravens make their voices heard. You water the mountains from your heavenly reservoirs; earth is supplied with plenty of water. You make grass grow for the livestock, hay for the animals that plow the ground. Oh yes, God brings grain from the land, wine to make people happy, Their faces glowing with health, a people well-fed and hearty. GOD\u2019s trees are well-watered\u2014 the Lebanon cedars he planted. Birds build their nests in those trees; look\u2014the stork at home in the treetop. Mountain goats climb about the cliffs; badgers burrow among the rocks. The moon keeps track of the seasons, the sun is in charge of each day. When it\u2019s dark and night takes over, all the forest creatures come out. The young lions roar for their prey, clamoring to God for their supper. When the sun comes up, they vanish, lazily stretched out in their dens. Meanwhile, men and women go out to work, busy at their jobs until evening."

After our parents left Egypt, they took your wonders for granted, forgot your great and wonderful love. They were barely beyond the Red Sea when they defied the High God \u2014the very place he saved them! \u2014the place he revealed his amazing power! He rebuked the Red Sea so that it dried up on the spot \u2014he paraded them right through! \u2014no one so much as got wet feet! He saved them from a life of oppression, pried them loose from the grip of the enemy. Then the waters flowed back on their oppressors; there wasn\u2019t a single survivor. Then they believed his words were true and broke out in songs of praise."

He proved to his people that he could do what he said: Hand them the nations on a platter\u2014a gift! He manufactures truth and justice; All his products are guaranteed to last\u2014 Never out-of-date, never obsolete, rust-proof. All that he makes and does is honest and true: He paid the ransom for his people, He ordered his Covenant kept forever. He\u2019s so personal and holy, worthy of our respect. The good life begins in the fear of GOD\u2014 Do that and you\u2019ll know the blessing of GOD. His Hallelujah lasts forever!"

GOD\u2019s my strong champion; I flick off my enemies like flies. Far better to take refuge in GOD than trust in people; Far better to take refuge in GOD than trust in celebrities. Hemmed in by barbarians, in GOD\u2019s name I rubbed their faces in the dirt; Hemmed in and with no way out, in GOD\u2019s name I rubbed their faces in the dirt; Like swarming bees, like wild prairie fire, they hemmed me in; in GOD\u2019s name I rubbed their faces in the dirt. I was right on the cliff-edge, ready to fall, when GOD grabbed and held me. GOD\u2019s my strength, he\u2019s also my song, and now he\u2019s my salvation. Hear the shouts, hear the triumph songs in the camp of the saved? \u201cThe hand of GOD has turned the tide! The hand of GOD is raised in victory! The hand of GOD has turned the tide!\u201d"
