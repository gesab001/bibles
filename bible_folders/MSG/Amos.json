                    "verse": "\u201cYes indeed, it won\u2019t be long now.\u201d GOD\u2019s Decree. \u201cThings are going to happen so fast your head will swim, one thing fast on the heels of the other. You won\u2019t be able to keep up. Everything will be happening at once\u2014and everywhere you look, blessings! Blessings like wine pouring off the mountains and hills. I\u2019ll make everything right again for my people Israel: \u201cThey\u2019ll rebuild their ruined cities. They\u2019ll plant vineyards and drink good wine. They\u2019ll work their gardens and eat fresh vegetables. And I\u2019ll plant them, plant them on their own land. They\u2019ll never again be uprooted from the land I\u2019ve given them.\u201d GOD, your God, says so."
