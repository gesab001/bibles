Blossoming flowers look beautiful before they\u2019re cut or picked, but without soil or water they wither more quickly than grass. That\u2019s what happens to all who forget God\u2014 all their hopes come to nothing. They hang their life from one thin thread, they hitch their fate to a spider web. One jiggle and the thread breaks, one jab and the web collapses. Or they\u2019re like weeds springing up in the sunshine, invading the garden, Spreading everywhere, overtaking the flowers, getting a foothold even in the rocks. But when the gardener rips them out by the roots, the garden doesn\u2019t miss them one bit. The sooner the godless are gone, the better; then good plants can grow in their place."
