It was immense, dwarfing all the trees in the forest\u2014 Thick boughs, long limbs, roots delving deep into earth\u2019s waters. All the birds of the air nested in its boughs. All the wild animals gave birth under its branches. All the mighty nations lived in its shade. It was stunning in its majesty\u2014 the reach of its branches! the depth of its water-seeking roots! Not a cedar in God\u2019s garden came close to it. No pine tree was anything like it. Mighty oaks looked like bushes growing alongside it. Not a tree in God\u2019s garden was in the same class of beauty.
