If I acted crazy, I did it for God; if I acted overly serious, I did it for you. Christ\u2019s love has moved me to such extremes. His love has the first and last word in everything we do. A New Life - Our firm decision is to work from this focused center: One man died for everyone. That puts everyone in the same boat. He included everyone in his death so that everyone could also be included in his life, a resurrection life, a far better life than people ever lived on their own."

I\u2019ve been shipwrecked three times, and immersed in the open sea for a night and a day.

I\u2019ve been at risk in the city, at risk in the country, endangered by desert sun and sea storm, and betrayed by those I thought were my brothers. I\u2019ve known drudgery and hard labor, many a long and lonely night without sleep, many a missed meal, blasted by the cold, naked to the weather."
