Thank God that you, who were at one time the servants of sin, honestly responded to the impact of Christ\u2019s teaching when you came under its influence. Then, released from the service of sin, you entered the service of righteousness. (I use an everyday illustration because human nature grasps truth more readily that way.) In the past you voluntarily gave your bodies to the service of vice and wickedness\u2014for the purpose of becoming wicked. So, now, give yourselves to the service of righteousness\u2014for the purpose of becoming really good. For when you were employed by sin you owed no duty to righteousness.
