If a fellow man or woman has no clothes to wear and nothing to eat, and one of you say, \u201cGood luck to you I hope you\u2019ll keep warm and find enough to eat\u201d, and yet give them nothing to meet their physical needs, what on earth is the good of that? Yet that is exactly what a bare faith without a corresponding life is like\u2014useless and dead. If we only \u201chave faith\u201d a man could easily challenge us by saying, \u201cyou say that you have faith and I have merely good actions. Well, all you can do is to show me a faith without corresponding actions, but I can show you by my actions that I have faith as well.\u201d To the man who thinks that faith by itself is enough I feel inclined to say, \u201cSo you believe that there is one God? That\u2019s fine. So do all the devils in hell and shudder in terror!\u201d For, my dear short-sighted man, can\u2019t you see far enough to realise that faith without the right actions is dead and useless? Think of Abraham, our ancestor. Wasn\u2019t it his action which really justified him in God\u2019s sight when his faith led him to offer his son Isaac on the altar? Can\u2019t you see that his faith and his actions were, so to speak, partners\u2014that his faith was implemented by his deed?
