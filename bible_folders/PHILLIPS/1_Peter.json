I speak as one who actually saw Christ suffer, and as one who will share with you the glories that are to be unfolded to us. I urge you then to see that your \u201cflock of God\u201d is properly fed and cared for. Accept the responsibility of looking after them willingly and not because you feel you can\u2019t get out of it, doing your work not for what you can make, but because you are really concerned for their well-being. You should aim not at being \u201clittle tin gods\u201d but as examples of Christian living in the eyes of the flock committed to your charge. And then, when the chief shepherd reveals himself, you will receive that crown of glory which cannot fade."
