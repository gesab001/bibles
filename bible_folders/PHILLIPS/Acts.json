Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, \u201cGet up quickly.\u201d His chains fell away from his hands and the angel said to him, \u201cFasten your belt and put on your sandals.\u201d And he did so. Then the angel continued, \u201cWrap your cloak round you and follow me.\u201d So Peter followed him out, not knowing whether what the angel was doing were real\u2014indeed he felt he must be taking part in a vision. So they passed right through the first and second guard-points and came to the iron gate that led out into the city. This opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and had passed along the street when the angel suddenly vanished from Peter\u2019s sight. Then Peter came to himself and said aloud, \u201cNow I know for certain that the Lord has sent his angel to rescue me from the power of Herod and from all that the Jewish people are expecting.\u201d As the truth broke upon him he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark where many were gathered together in prayer.

On their arrival at Salamis they began to proclaim God\u2019s message in the Jewish synagogues, having John as their assistant. As they made their way through the island as far as Paphos they came across a man named Bar-Jesus, a Jew who was both a false prophet and a magician. This man was attached to Sergius Paulus, the proconsul, who was himself a man of intelligence. He sent for Barnabas and Saul as he was anxious to hear God\u2019s message. But Elymas the magician (for that is the translation of his name), opposed them doing his best to dissuade the proconsul from accepting the faith. Then Saul (who is also called Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, eyed him closely and said, \u201cYou son of the devil, you enemy of all true goodness, you monster of trickery and evil, is it not time you gave up trying to pervert the truth of the Lord?

But Paul called out to him at the top of his voice, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt yourself\u2014we are all here!\u201d"

After sighting Cyprus and leaving it on our left we sailed to Syria and put in at Tyre, since that was where the ship was to discharge her cargo. We sought out the disciples there and stayed with them for a week. They felt led by the Spirit again and again to warn Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. But when our time was up we left there and continued our journey. They all came out to see us off, bringing their wives and children with them, accompanying us till we were outside the city. Then kneeling down on the beach we prayed and said good-bye to each other. Then we went aboard the ship while the disciples went back home. We sailed away from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais.
